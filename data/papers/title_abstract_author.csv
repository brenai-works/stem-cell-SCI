Spinal cord injury: molecular mechanisms and therapeutic interventions,"Hu X, Xu W, Ren Y, Wang Z, He X, Huang R, Ma B, Zhao J, Zhu R, Cheng L.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) remains a severe condition with an extremely high disability rate. The challenges of SCI repair include its complex pathological mechanisms and the difficulties of neural regeneration in the central nervous system. In the past few decades, researchers have attempted to completely elucidate the pathological mechanism of SCI and identify effective strategies to promote axon regeneration and neural circuit remodeling, but the results have not been ideal. Recently, new pathological mechanisms of SCI, especially the interactions between immune and neural cell responses, have been revealed by single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptome analysis. With the development of bioactive materials and stem cells, more attention has been focused on forming intermediate neural networks to promote neural regeneration and neural circuit reconstruction than on promoting axonal regeneration in the corticospinal tract. Furthermore, technologies to control physical parameters such as electricity, magnetism and ultrasound have been constantly innovated and applied in neural cell fate regulation. Among these advanced novel strategies and technologies, stem cell therapy, biomaterial transplantation, and electromagnetic stimulation have entered into the stage of clinical trials, and some of them have already been applied in clinical treatment. In this review, we outline the overall epidemiology and pathophysiology of SCI, expound on the latest research progress related to neural regeneration and circuit reconstruction in detail, and propose future directions for SCI repair and clinical applications."
Cell-based and stem-cell-based treatments for spinal cord injury: evidence from clinical trials,"Zipser CM, Cragg JJ, Guest JD, Fehlings MG, Jutzeler CR, Anderson AJ, Curt A.","AB  - Spinal cord injury is a severely disabling neurological condition leading to impaired mobility, pain, and autonomic dysfunction. Most often, a single traumatic event, such as a traffic or recreational accident, leads to primary spinal cord damage through compression and laceration, followed by secondary damage consisting of inflammation and ischaemia, and culminating in substantial tissue loss. Patients need appropriate timely surgical and critical care, followed by neurorehabilitation to facilitate neuronal reorganisation and functional compensation. Although some neurological function might be regained, most patients with initially complete lesions have severe, irreversible neurological impairment. Cell-based and stem-cell-based therapies are recognised as promising candidates to promote functional recovery. However, no trials of these therapies in patients have yet provided reproducible evidence for clinical efficacy, challenged by small effect sizes, low immune suppression, and low sensitivity study designs. Nevertheless, in the past decade, clinical trials have shown the feasibility and long-term safety of cell transplantation into the injured spinal cord. This crucial milestone has paved the way to consider refinements and combined therapies, such as the use of biomaterials to augment the effects of cell transplantation. In the future, emerging cell types, scaffolding, and cell engineering might improve cell survival, integration, and therapeutic efficiency."
"Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Spinal Cord Injury: Current Options, Limitations, and Future of Cell Therapy","Cofano F, Boido M, Monticelli M, Zenga F, Ducati A, Vercelli A, Garbossa D.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) constitutes an inestimable public health issue. The most crucial phase in the pathophysiological process of SCI concerns the well-known secondary injury, which is the uncontrolled and destructive cascade occurring later with aberrant molecular signaling, inflammation, vascular changes, and secondary cellular dysfunctions. The use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represents one of the most important and promising tested strategies. Their appeal, among the other sources and types of stem cells, increased because of their ease of isolation/preservation and their properties. Nevertheless, encouraging promise from preclinical studies was followed by weak and conflicting results in clinical trials. In this review, the therapeutic role of MSCs is discussed, together with their properties, application, limitations, and future perspectives."
Crosstalk between stem cell and spinal cord injury: pathophysiology and treatment strategies,"Shao A, Tu S, Lu J, Zhang J.","AB  - The injured spinal cord is difficult to repair and regenerate. Traditional treatments are not effective. Stem cells are a type of cells that have the potential to differentiate into various cells, including neurons. They exert a therapeutic effect by safely and effectively differentiating into neurons or replacing damaged cells, secreting neurotrophic factors, and inhibiting the inflammatory response. Many types of stem cells have been used for transplantation, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. This review discusses the possible mechanisms of stem cell therapy for spinal cord injury, and the types of stem cells commonly used in experiments, to provide a reference for basic and clinical research on stem cell therapy for spinal cord injury."
Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes: therapeutic opportunities and challenges for spinal cord injury,"Liu WZ, Ma ZJ, Li JR, Kang XW.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) often leads to serious motor and sensory dysfunction of the limbs below the injured segment. SCI not only results in physical and psychological harm to patients but can also cause a huge economic burden on their families and society. As there is no effective treatment method, the prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of patients with SCI have become urgent problems to be solved. In recent years, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have attracted more attention in the treatment of SCI. Although MSC therapy can reduce injured volume and promote axonal regeneration, its application is limited by tumorigenicity, a low survival rate, and immune rejection. Accumulating literature shows that exosomes have great potential in the treatment of SCI. In this review, we summarize the existing MSC-derived exosome studies on SCI and discuss the advantages and challenges of treating SCI based on exosomes derived from MSCs."
Immune response following traumatic spinal cord injury: Pathophysiology and therapies,"Sterner RC, Sterner RM.","AB  - Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition that is often associated with significant loss of function and/or permanent disability. The pathophysiology of SCI is complex and occurs in two phases. First, the mechanical damage from the trauma causes immediate acute cell dysfunction and cell death. Then, secondary mechanisms of injury further propagate the cell dysfunction and cell death over the course of days, weeks, or even months. Among the secondary injury mechanisms, inflammation has been shown to be a key determinant of the secondary injury severity and significantly worsens cell death and functional outcomes. Thus, in addition to surgical management of SCI, selectively targeting the immune response following SCI could substantially decrease the progression of secondary injury and improve patient outcomes. In order to develop such therapies, a detailed molecular understanding of the timing of the immune response following SCI is necessary. Recently, several studies have mapped the cytokine/chemokine and cell proliferation patterns following SCI. In this review, we examine the immune response underlying the pathophysiology of SCI and assess both current and future therapies including pharmaceutical therapies, stem cell therapy, and the exciting potential of extracellular vesicle therapy."
Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation: Neuroprotection and Nerve Regeneration After Spinal Cord Injury,"Chen SY, Yang RL, Wu XC, Zhao DZ, Fu SP, Lin FQ, Li LY, Yu LM, Zhang Q, Zhang T.","AB  - Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a leading cause of lifelong disabilities. Permanent sensory, motor and autonomic impairments after SCI are substantially attributed to degeneration of spinal cord neurons and axons, and disintegration of neural network. To date, minimal regenerative treatments are available for SCI with an unmet need for new therapies to reconstruct the damaged spinal cord neuron-glia network and restore connectivity with the supraspinal pathways. Multipotent neural precursor cells (NPCs) have a unique capacity to generate neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. Due to this capacity, NPCs have been an attractive cell source for cellular therapies for SCI. Transplantation of NPCs has been extensively tested in preclinical models of SCI in the past two decades. These studies have identified opportunities and challenges associated with NPC therapies. While NPCs have the potential to promote neuroregeneration through various mechanisms, their low long-term survival and integration within the host injured spinal cord limit the functional benefits of NPC-based therapies for SCI. To address this challenge, combinatorial strategies have been developed to optimize the outcomes of NPC therapies by enriching SCI microenvironment through biomaterials, genetic and pharmacological therapies. In this review, we will provide an in-depth discussion on recent advances in preclinical NPC-based therapies for SCI. We will discuss modes of actions and mechanism by which engrafted NPCs contribute to the repair process and functional recovery. We will also provide an update on current clinical trials and new technologies that have facilitated preparation of medical-grade human NPCs suitable for transplantation in clinical studies."
Role of Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes and microRNAs in Spinal Cord Injury,"Hwang J, Jang S, Kim C, Lee S, Jeong HS.","AB  - Spinal Cord Injury (SCI), with its morbidity characteristics of high disability rate and high mortality rate, is a disease that is highly destructive to both the physiology and psychology of the patient, and for which there is still a lack of effective treatment. Following spinal cord injury, a cascade of secondary injury reactions known as ischemia, peripheral inflammatory cell infiltration, oxidative stress, etc. create a microenvironment that is unfavorable to neural recovery and ultimately results in apoptosis and necrosis of neurons and glial cells. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation has emerged as a more promising therapeutic options in recent years. MSC can promote spinal cord injury repair through a variety of mechanisms, including immunomodulation, neuroprotection, and nerve regeneration, giving patients with spinal cord injury hope. In this paper, it is discussed the neuroprotection and nerve regeneration components of MSCs' therapeutic method for treating spinal cord injuries."
Progress in Stem Cell Therapy for Spinal Cord Injury,"Gao L, Peng Y, Xu W, He P, Li T, Lu X, Chen G.","AB  - OBJECTIVE: This article provides a review of the initial clinical and radiologic evaluation and treatment of patients with traumatic spinal cord injuries. It specifically highlights essential knowledge for neurologists who encounter patients with these complex injuries. LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: There has been improvement in the care of patients with traumatic spinal cord injuries, particularly in the prehospital evaluation, approach for immediate immobilization, standardized spinal clearance, efficient triage, and transportation of appropriate patients to traumatic spinal cord injury specialized centers. Advancements in spinal instrumentation have improved the surgical management of spinal fractures and the ability to manage patients with spinal mechanical instability. The clinical evidence favors performing early surgical decompression and spine stabilization within 24 hours of traumatic spinal cord injuries, regardless of the severity or location of the injury. There is no evidence that supports the use of neuroprotective treatments to improve outcomes in patients with traumatic spinal cord injuries. The administration of high-dose methylprednisolone, which is associated with significant systemic adverse effects, is strongly discouraged. Early and delayed mortality rates continue to be high in patients with traumatic spinal cord injuries, and survivors often confront substantial long-term physical and functional impairments. Whereas the exploration of neuroregenerative approaches, such as stem cell transplantation, is underway, these methods remain largely investigational. Further research is still necessary to advance the functional recovery of patients with traumatic spinal cord injuries. ESSENTIAL POINTS: Traumatic spinal cord injury is a complex and devastating condition that leads to long-term neurologic deficits with profound physical, social, and vocational implications, resulting in a diminished quality of life, particularly for severely affected patients. The initial management of traumatic spinal cord injuries demands comprehensive interdisciplinary care to address the potentially catastrophic multisystem effects. Ongoing endeavors are focused on optimizing and customizing initial management approaches and developing effective therapies for neuroprotection and neuroregeneration to enhance long-term functional recovery."
Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury,Izzy S.,"AB  - Neurological disorders represent a global health problem. Current pharmacological treatments often lead to short-term symptomatic relief but have dose-dependent side effects, such as inducing orthostatic arterial hypotension due to the blockade of alpha receptors, cardiotoxic effects due to impaired repolarization, and atrioventricular block and tachycardia, including ventricular fibrillation. These challenges have driven the medical community to seek effective treatments for this serious global health threat. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent cells with anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and immunomodulatory properties, providing a promising alternative due to their ability to differentiate, favorable culture conditions, in vitro manipulation ability, and robust properties. Although MSCs themselves rarely differentiate into neurons at the site of injury after transplantation in vivo, paracrine factors secreted by MSCs can create environmental conditions for cell-to-cell communication and have shown therapeutic effects. Recent studies have shown that the pleiotropic effects of MSCs, particularly their immunomodulatory potential, can be attributed primarily to these paracrine factors. Exosomes derived from MSCs are known to play an important role in these effects. Many studies have evaluated the potential of exosome-based therapies for the treatment of various neurological diseases. In addition to exosomes, various miRNAs derived from MSCs have been identified to regulate genes and alleviate neuropathological changes in neurodegenerative diseases. This review explores the burgeoning field of exosome-based therapies, focusing on the effects of MSC-derived exosomes and exosomal miRNAs, and summarizes recent findings that shed light on the potential of exosomes in the treatment of neurological disorders. The insights gained from this review may pave the way for innovative and effective treatments for these complex conditions. Furthermore, we suggest the therapeutic effects of exosomes and exosomal miRNAs from MSCs, which have a rescue potential in spinal cord injury via diverse signaling pathways."
Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation for Spinal Cord Injury: Current Status and Prospects,"Hirota R, Sasaki M, Honmou O, Yamashita T.","AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the serious neurological diseases that occur in young people with high morbidity and disability. However, there is still a lack of effective treatments for it. Stem cell (SC) treatment of SCI has gradually become a new research hotspot over the past decades. This article is aimed at reviewing the research progress of SC therapy for SCI. METHODS: Review the literature and summarize the effects, strategies, related mechanisms, safety, and clinical application of different SC types and new approaches in combination with SC in SCI treatment. RESULTS: A large number of studies have focused on SC therapy for SCI, most of which showed good effects. The common SC types for SCI treatment include mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), neural stem cells (NSCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The modes of treatment include in vivo and in vitro induction. The pathways of transplantation consist of intravenous, transarterial, nasal, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, and intramedullary injections. Most of the SC treatments for SCI use a number of cells ranging from tens of thousands to millions. Early or late SC administration, application of immunosuppressant or not are still controversies. Potential mechanisms of SC therapy include tissue repair and replacement, neurotrophy, and regeneration and promotion of angiogenesis, antiapoptosis, and anti-inflammatory. Common safety issues include thrombosis and embolism, tumorigenicity and instability, infection, high fever, and even death. Recently, some new approaches, such as the pharmacological activation of endogenous SCs, biomaterials, 3D print, and optogenetics, have been also developed, which greatly improved the application of SC therapy for SCI. CONCLUSION: Most studies support the effects of SC therapy on SCI, while a few studies do not. The cell types, mechanisms, and strategies of SC therapy for SCI are very different among studies. In addition, the safety cannot be ignored, and more clinical trials are required. The application of new technology will promote SC therapy of SCI."
Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy in Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury: A Systematic Review,"Montoto-Meijide R, Meijide-Faílde R, Díaz-Prado SM, Montoto-Marqués A.","AB  - Recovery from a traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) is challenging due to the limited regenerative capacity of the central nervous system to restore cells, myelin, and neural connections. Cell therapy, particularly with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), holds significant promise for TSCI treatment. This systematic review aims to analyze the efficacy, safety, and therapeutic potential of MSC-based cell therapies in TSCI. A comprehensive search of PUBMED and COCHRANE databases until February 2023 was conducted, combining terms such as spinal cord injury"
Clinical Trials of Stem Cell Treatment for Spinal Cord Injury,"Yamazaki K, Kawabori M, Seki T, Houkin K.","AB  - Since the 1990s, our group has been conducting basic research on regenerative medicine using various cell types to treat several central nervous system diseases, including spinal cord injury (SCI). We have reported many positive effects of the intravenous administration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from the bone marrow. In the current study, MSCs were administered intravenously to a rat model of severe SCI (crush injury) during the acute to subacute stages-considerable motor function recovery was observed. Furthermore, MSC transplantation in a chronic-phase SCI model improved motor function. In this review, we discuss recent updates in basic research on the intravenous infusion of MSCs and prospects for SCI research."
Neural stem cell therapies for spinal cord injury repair: an update on recent preclinical and clinical advances,"Hosseini SM, Borys B, Karimi-Abdolrezaee S.","AB  - There are more than one million patients worldwide suffering paralysis caused by spinal cord injury (SCI). SCI causes severe socioeconomic problems not only to the patients and their caregivers but also to society; therefore, the development of innovative treatments is crucial. Many pharmacological therapies have been attempted in an effort to reduce SCI-related damage; however, no single therapy that could dramatically improve the serious long-term sequelae of SCI has emerged. Stem cell transplantation therapy, which can ameliorate damage or regenerate neurological networks, has been proposed as a promising candidate for SCI treatment, and many basic and clinical experiments using stem cells for SCI treatment have been launched, with promising results. However, the cell transplantation methods, including cell type, dose, transplantation route, and transplantation timing, vary widely between trials, and there is no consensus regarding the most effective treatment strategy. This study reviews the current knowledge on this issue, with a special focus on the clinical trials that have used stem cells for treating SCI, and highlights the problems that remain to be solved before the widespread clinical use of stem cells can be adopted."
Stem cell paracrine effect and delivery strategies for spinal cord injury regeneration,"Veneruso V, Rossi F, Villella A, Bena A, Forloni G, Veglianese P.","AB  - BACKGROUND AIMS: Exosome therapy for traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) is a current research hotspot, but its therapeutic effect and the best source of stem cells for exosomes are unclear. METHODS: The Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Scopus databases were searched from inception to March 28, 2023. Literature screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed independently by two investigators. RESULTS: A total of 40 studies were included for data analysis. The findings of our traditional meta-analysis indicate that exosomes derived from stem cells significantly improve the motor function of TSCI at various time points (1 week: weighted mean difference [WMD] = 1.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87-2.30] 2 weeks: WMD = 3.12, 95% CI 2.64-3.61; 3 weeks: WMD = 4.44, 95% CI 3.27-5.60; 4 weeks: WMD = 4.54, 95% CI 3.42-5.66). Four kinds of stem cell-derived exosomes have been studied: bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, adipose mesenchymal stem cells, umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells and neural stem cells. The results of the network meta-analysis showed that there was no significant statistical difference in the therapeutic effect among the exosomes derived from four kinds of stem cells at different treatment time points. Although exosomes derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells are the current research focus, exosomes derived from neural stem cells have the most therapeutic potential and should become the focus of future attention. CONCLUSIONS: The exosomes derived from stem cells can significantly improve the motor function of TSCI rats, and the exosomes derived from neural stem cells have the most therapeutic potential. However, the lower evidence quality of animal studies limits the reliability of experimental results, emphasizing the need for more high-quality, direct comparative studies to explore the therapeutic efficacy of exosomes and the best source of stem cells."

Multipotent Stem Cell and Current Application,"Sobhani A, Khanlarkhani N, Baazm M, Mohammadzadeh F, Najafi A, Mehdinejadiani S, Sargolzaei Aval F.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system that can lead to permanent loss of sensation and voluntary movement beyond the affected area. Extensive preclinical and clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of stem cells for the treatment of various central nervous system diseases or disorders, including SCI. However, several challenges hinder nerve cell regeneration in the injured spinal cord, such as extensive cell loss, limited neural cell regeneration capacity, axonal disruption, and the presence of growth-inhibiting molecules, particularly astroglial scarring or glial scars at the injury site in chronic cases. These obstacles pose significant challenges for physicians in restoring normal motor and sensory nerve function in both humans and animals following SCI. This review focuses on SCI pathogenesis, the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cells in SCI, and the potential of stem cell-based therapies as promising avenues for treatment. This review article also included relevant preclinical and clinical data from animal studies."
Multipotent Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Based Therapies for Spinal Cord Injury: Current Progress and Future Prospects,Zeng CW.,"AB  - Stem cells are self-renewing and undifferentiated cell types that can be differentiate into functional cells. Stem cells can be classified into two main types based on their source of origin: Embryonic and Adult stem cells. Stem cells also classified based on the range of differentiation potentials into Totipotent, Pluripotent, Multipotent, and Unipotent. Multipotent stem cells have the ability to differentiate into all cell types within one particular lineage. There are plentiful advantages and usages for multipotent stem cells. Multipotent Stem cells act as a significant key in procedure of development, tissue repair, and protection. Multipotent Stem cells have been applying in treatment of different disorders such as spinal cord injury, bone fracture, autoimmune diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, hematopoietic defects, and fertility preservation."
Recent advances in endogenous neural stem/progenitor cell manipulation for spinal cord injury repair,"Li J, Luo W, Xiao C, Zhao J, Xiang C, Liu W, Gu R.","AB  - Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) can cause severe neurological impairments. Clinically available treatments are quite limited, with unsatisfactory remediation effects. Residing endogenous neural stem/progenitor cells (eNSPCs) tend to differentiate towards astrocytes, leaving only a small fraction towards oligodendrocytes and even fewer towards neurons; this has been suggested as one of the reasons for the failure of autonomous neuronal regeneration. Thus, finding ways to recruit and facilitate the differentiation of eNSPCs towards neurons has been considered a promising strategy for the noninvasive and immune-compatible treatment of SCI. The present manuscript first introduces the responses of eNSPCs after exogenous interventions to boost endogenous neurogenesis in various SCI models. Then, we focus on state-of-art manipulation approaches that enhance the intrinsic neurogenesis capacity and reconstruct the hostile microenvironment, mainly consisting of pharmacological treatments, stem cell-derived exosome administration, gene therapy, functional scaffold implantation, inflammation regulation, and inhibitory element delineation. Facing the extremely complex situation of SCI, combined treatments are also highlighted to provide more clues for future relevant investigations."
Role of endogenous neural stem cells in spinal cord injury and repair,"Stenudd M, Sabelström H, Frisén J.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) represents a significant medical challenge, often resulting in permanent disability and severely impacting the quality of life for affected individuals. Traditional treatment options remain limited, underscoring the need for novel therapeutic approaches. In recent years, multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as a promising candidate for SCI treatment due to their multifaceted regenerative capabilities. This comprehensive review synthesizes the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying MSC-mediated tissue repair in SCI. Key mechanisms discussed include neuroprotection through the secretion of growth factors and cytokines, promotion of neuronal regeneration via MSC differentiation into neural cell types, angiogenesis through the release of pro-angiogenic factors, immunomodulation by modulating immune cell activity, axonal regeneration driven by neurotrophic factors, and glial scar reduction via modulation of extracellular matrix components. Additionally, the review examines the various clinical applications of MSCs in SCI treatment, such as direct cell transplantation into the injured spinal cord, tissue engineering using biomaterial scaffolds that support MSC survival and integration, and innovative cell-based therapies like MSC-derived exosomes, which possess regenerative and neuroprotective properties. As the field progresses, it is crucial to address the challenges associated with MSC-based therapies, including determining optimal sources, intervention timing, and delivery methods, as well as developing standardized protocols for MSC isolation, expansion, and characterization. Overcoming these challenges will facilitate the translation of preclinical findings into clinical practice, providing new hope and improved treatment options for individuals living with the devastating consequences of SCI."
Regenerative Rehabilitation and Stem Cell Therapy Targeting Chronic Spinal Cord Injury: A Review of Preclinical Studies,"Tashiro S, Nakamura M, Okano H.","AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to conduct a bibliometric analysis of the literature on stem cell treatment for spinal cord injury to gain an intuitive understanding of how the field is progressing, discover topics of interest, and determine what development trends are emerging in this field. Background: Spinal cord injury and its complications often cause an enormous economic burden, and postinjury repair and treatment have always been challenging in clinical and scientific research. Stem cell therapy for spinal cord injury can prevent immune rejection and induce the release of neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory factors to reduce the production of stress-related proteins, reactive oxygen species, and inflammatory reactions. Methods: We analyzed the number and quality of publications in the field of stem cell therapy in spinal cord injury between 2018.01.01 and 2023.06.30 in the core collection database of Web of Science. CiteSpace and VOSviewer were used to sort and summarize these studies by country, institution, authors' publications, and collaborative networks. In addition, the research topics of interest were identified and summarized. Results: This study ultimately included 2,150 valid papers, with the number of publications showing a gradual upward trend. The country, institution, author and journal with the greatest number of publications and citations are China, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dai JW, and the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, respectively. The top three high-frequency keyword clusters were hereditary paraplegia, reactive astrocytes and tissue engineering. Conclusion: With the help of visual analysis, we identified general trends and research topics of interest in the field of spinal cord injury over the last 5 years. Our findings suggest that stem cell transplantation for spinal cord injury and exosome therapy may be a focus of future research. This study provides a foundation for future research on stem cell therapy as well as clinical efforts in this field."
Biomaterials and Magnetic Stem Cell Delivery in the Treatment of Spinal Cord Injury,Kubinová Š.,"AB  - Spinal cord injury is followed by glial scar formation, which has positive and negative effects on recovery from the lesion. More than half of the astrocytes in the glial scar are generated by ependymal cells, the neural stem cells in the spinal cord. We recently demonstrated that the neural stem cell-derived scar component has several beneficial functions, including restricting tissue damage and neural loss after spinal cord injury. This finding identifies endogenous neural stem cells as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of spinal cord injury."
"Advancing Spinal Cord Injury Treatment through Stem Cell Therapy: A Comprehensive Review of Cell Types, Challenges, and Emerging Technologies in Regenerative Medicine",Zeng CW.,"AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a serious trauma, which often results in a permanent loss of motor and sensory functions, pain and spasticity. Despite extensive research, there is currently no available therapy that would restore the lost functions after SCI in human patients. Advanced treatments use regenerative medicine or its combination with various interdisciplinary approaches such as tissue engineering or biophysical methods. This review summarizes and critically discusses the research from specific interdisciplinary fields in SCI treatment such as the development of biomaterials as scaffolds for tissue repair, and using a magnetic field for targeted cell delivery. We compare the treatment effects of synthetic non-degradable methacrylate-based hydrogels and biodegradable biological scaffolds based on extracellular matrix. The systems using magnetic fields for magnetically guided delivery of stem cells loaded with magnetic nanoparticles into the lesion site are then suggested and discussed."

Current treatments for SCIs are limited in their ability to restore function, and there is a pressing need for innovative therapeutic approaches. Stem cell therapy has emerged as a promising strategy to promote the regeneration and repair of damaged neural tissue following SCIs. This review article comprehensively discusses the potential of different stem cell types, such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs), in SCI treatment. We provide an in-depth analysis of the unique advantages and challenges associated with each stem cell type, as well as the latest advancements in the field.

Stem Cell Therapy in Spinal Cord Injury-Induced Neurogenic Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction,"Ou YC, Huang CC, Kao YL, Ho PC, Tsai KJ.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a complicated neuropathological condition that results in functional dysfunction and paralysis. Various treatments have been proposed including drugs, biological factors and cells administered in several ways. Stem cell therapy offers a potentially revolutionary mode to repair the damaged spinal cord after injury. Initially, stem cells were considered promising for replacing cells and tissue lost after SCI. Many studies looked at their differentiation to replace neuronal and glial cells for a better functional outcome. However, it is becoming clear that different functional improvements recognized to stem cells are due to biomolecular activities by the transplanted stem cells rather than cell replacement. This review aimed to discuss the paracrine mechanisms for tissue repair and regeneration after stem cell transplantation in SCI. It focuses on stem cell factor production, effect in tissue restoration, and novel delivery strategies to use them for SCI therapy."
Stem cell-derived neuronal relay strategies and functional electrical stimulation for treatment of spinal cord injury,"Lai BQ, Zeng X, Han WT, Che MT, Ding Y, Li G, Zeng YS.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition that enormously affects an individual's health and quality of life. Neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) is one of the most important sequelae induced by SCI, causing complications including urinary tract infection, renal function deterioration, urinary incontinence, and voiding dysfunction. Current therapeutic methods for SCI-induced NLUTD mainly target on the urinary bladder, but the outcomes are still far from satisfactory. Stem cell therapy has gained increasing attention for years for its ability to rescue the injured spinal cord directly. Stem cell differentiation and their paracrine effects, including exosomes, are the proposed mechanisms to enhance the recovery from SCI. Several animal studies have demonstrated improvement in bladder function using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and neural stem cells (NSCs). Human clinical trials also provide promising results in urodynamic parameters after MSC therapy. However, there is still uncertainty about the ideal treatment window and application protocol for stem cell therapy. Besides, data on the therapeutic effects regarding NSCs and stem cell-derived exosomes in SCI-related NLUTD are scarce. Therefore, there is a pressing need for further well-designed human clinical trials to translate the stem cell therapy into a formal therapeutic option for SCI-induced NLUTD."
Stem cell-derived exosomes for traumatic spinal cord injury: a systematic review and network meta-analysis based on a rat model,"Shang Z, Wanyan P, Wang M, Zhang B, Cui X, Wang X.","AB  - Stem cell medicine has led to functional recovery in the acute-to-subacute phase of spinal cord injury (SCI), but not yet in the chronic phase, during which various molecular mechanisms drastically remodel the tissue and render it treatment-resistant. Researchers are attempting to identify effective combinatorial treatments that can overcome the refractory state of the chronically injured spinal cord. Regenerative rehabilitation, combinatorial treatment with regenerative medicine that aims to elicit synergistic effects, is being developed. Rehabilitation upon SCI in preclinical studies has recently attracted more attention because it is safe, induces neuronal plasticity involving transplanted stem cells and sensorimotor circuits, and is routinely implemented in human clinics. However, regenerative rehabilitation has not been extensively reviewed, and only a few reviews have focused on the use of physical medicine modalities for rehabilitative purposes, which might be more important in the chronic phase. Here, we summarize regenerative rehabilitation studies according to the effector, site, and mechanism. Specifically, we describe effects on transplanted cells, microstructures at and distant from the lesion, and molecular changes. To establish a treatment regimen that induces robust functional recovery upon chronic SCI, further investigations are required of combinatorial treatments incorporating stem cell therapy, regenerative rehabilitation, and medication."
Human stem cell-derived neurons and neural circuitry therapeutics: Next frontier in spinal cord injury repair,"Paredes-Espinosa MB, Paluh JL.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a serious condition accompanied by severe adverse events that affect several aspects of the patient's life, such as motor, sensory, and functional impairment. Despite its severe consequences, definitive treatment for these injuries is still missing. Therefore, researchers have focused on developing treatment strategies aimed at ensuring full recovery post-SCI. Accordingly, attention has been drawn toward cellular therapy using mesenchymal stem cells. Considering their wide availability, decreased immunogenicity, wide expansion capacity, and impressive effectiveness in many therapeutic approaches, adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC) injections in SCI cases have been investigated and showed promising results. In this review, SCI pathophysiology and ADSC transplantation benefits are discussed independently, together with SCI animal models and adipose stem cell preparation and application techniques. The mechanisms of healing in an SCI post-ADSC injection, the outcomes of this therapeutic approach, and current clinical trials are also deliberated, in addition to the challenges and future perspectives, aiming to encourage further research in this field."
Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Neurological Disorders,"Andrzejewska A, Dabrowska S, Lukomska B, Janowski M.","AB  - The inability of adult mammals to recover function lost after severe spinal cord injury (SCI) has been known for millennia and is mainly attributed to a failure of brain-derived nerve fiber regeneration across the lesion. Potential approaches to re-establishing locomotor function rely on neuronal relays to reconnect the segregated neural networks of the spinal cord. Intense research over the past 30 years has focused on endogenous and exogenous neuronal relays, but progress has been slow and the results often controversial. Treatments with stem cell-derived neuronal relays alone or together with functional electrical stimulation offer the possibility of improved repair of neuronal networks. In this review, we focus on approaches to recovery of motor function in paralyzed patients after severe SCI based on novel therapies such as implantation of stem cell-derived neuronal relays and functional electrical stimulation. Recent research progress offers hope that SCI patients will one day be able to recover motor function and sensory perception."
Advancements and mechanisms of stem cell-based therapies for spinal cord injury in animals,"Mili B, Choudhary OP.","AB  - Over the past decade, we have witnessed the development of cell transplantation as a new strategy for repairing spinal cord injury (SCI). However, due to the complexity of the central nervous system (CNS), achieving successful clinical translation remains a significant challenge. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUMSCs) possess distinct advantages, such as easy collection, lack of ethical concerns, high self-renewal ability, multilineage differentiation potential, and immunomodulatory properties. hUMSCs are promising for regenerating the injured spinal cord to a significant extent. At the same time, for advancing SCI treatment, the appropriate benefit and risk evaluation methods play a pivotal role in determining the clinical applicability of treatment plans. Hence, this study discusses the advantages and risks of hUMSCs in SCI treatment across four dimensions-comprehensive evaluation of motor and sensory function, imaging, electrophysiology, and autonomic nervous system (ANS) function-aiming to improve the rationality of relevant clinical research and the feasibility of clinical translation."
Cell therapy and delivery strategies for spinal cord injury,"Ramalho BDS, de Almeida FM, Martinez AMB.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI), a prominent health issue, represents a substantial portion of the global health care burden. Stem cell-based therapies provide novel solutions for SCI treatment, yet obstacles remain in the form of low survival rate, uncontrolled differentiation, and functional recovery. The application of engineered biomaterials in stem cell therapy provides a physicochemical microenvironment that mimics the stem cell niche, facilitating self-renewal, stem cell differentiation, and tissue reorganization. Nonetheless, external microenvironment support is inadequate, and some obstacles persist, for example, limited sources, gradual aging, and immunogenicity of stem cells. Targeted stem cell gene manipulation could eliminate many of these drawbacks, allowing safer, more effective use under regulation of intrinsic mechanisms. Additionally, through genetic labeling of stem cells, their role in tissue engineering may be elucidated. Therefore, combining stem cell therapy, materials science, and genetic modification technologies may shed light on SCI treatment. Herein, recent advances and advantages of biomaterials and gene manipulation, especially with respect to stem cell-based therapies, are highlighted, and their joint performance in SCI is evaluated. Current technological limitations and perspectives on future directions are then discussed. Although this combination is still in the early stages of development, it is highly likely to substantially contribute to stem cell-based therapies in the foreseeable future."
Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Conditioned Medium Promotes Functional Recovery Following Spinal Cord Injury: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Sarveazad A, Toloui A, Moarrefzadeh A, Nafchi HG, Neishaboori AM, Yousefifard M.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) remains a life-altering event that devastates those injured and the families that support them. Numerous laboratories are engaged in preclinical and clinical trials to repair the injured spinal cord with stem cell-derived therapeutics. A new developmental paradigm reveals early bifurcation of brain or trunk neurons in mammals via neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) relevant to therapies requiring homotypic spinal cord neural populations. Human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) NMP-derived spinal motor neurons generated ex vivo following this natural developmental route demonstrate robust survival in vivo when delivered as suspension grafts or as in vitro preformed encapsulated neuronal circuitry when transplanted into a rat C4-C5 hemicontusion injury site. Use of in vitro matured neurons avoids in vivo differentiation challenges of using pluripotent hiPSC or multipotent neural stem cell (NSC) or mesenchymal stem cell therapeutics. In this review, we provide an injury to therapeutics overview focusing on how stem cell and developmental fields are merging to generate exquisitely matched spinal motor neurons for SCI therapeutic studies. The complexity of the SCI microenvironment generated by trauma to neurons and vasculature, along with infiltrating inflammatory cells and scarring, underlies the challenging cytokine microenvironment that therapeutic cells encounter. An overview of evolving but limited stem cell-based SCI therapies that have progressed from preclinical to clinical trials illustrates the challenges and need for additional stem cell-based therapeutic approaches. The focus here on neurons describes how NMP-based neurotechnologies are advancing parallel strategies such as transplantation of preformed neuronal circuitry as well as human in vitro gastruloid multicellular models of trunk central and peripheral nervous system integration with organs. NMP-derived neurons are expected to be powerful drivers of the next generation of SCI therapeutics and integrate well with combination therapies that may utilize alternate biomimetic scaffolds for bridging injuries or flexible biodegradable electronics for electrostimulation."
Cell transplantation therapies for spinal cord injury focusing on bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells: Advances and challenges,"Huang LY, Sun X, Pan HX, Wang L, He CQ, Wei Q.","AB  - Neurological disorders are becoming a growing burden as society ages, and there is a compelling need to address this spiraling problem. Stem cell-based regenerative medicine is becoming an increasingly attractive approach to designing therapies for such disorders. The unique characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) make them among the most sought after cell sources. Researchers have extensively studied the modulatory properties of MSCs and their engineering, labeling, and delivery methods to the brain. The first part of this review provides an overview of studies on the application of MSCs to various neurological diseases, including stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other less frequently studied clinical entities. In the second part, stem cell delivery to the brain is focused. This fundamental but still understudied problem needs to be overcome to apply stem cells to brain diseases successfully. Here the value of cell engineering is also emphasized to facilitate MSC diapedesis, migration, and homing to brain areas affected by the disease to implement precision medicine paradigms into stem cell-based therapies."
Electro-acupuncture and its combination with adult stem cell transplantation for spinal cord injury treatment: A summary of current laboratory findings and a review of literature,"Zeng YS, Ding Y, Xu HY, Zeng X, Lai BQ, Li G, Ma YH.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition with complex pathological mechanisms that lead to sensory, motor, and autonomic dysfunction below the site of injury. To date, no effective therapy is available for the treatment of SCI. Recently, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) have been considered to be the most promising source for cellular therapies following SCI. The objective of the present review is to summarize the most recent insights into the cellular and molecular mechanism using BMMSC therapy to treat SCI. In this work, we review the specific mechanism of BMMSCs in SCI repair mainly from the following aspects: Neuroprotection, axon sprouting and/or regeneration, myelin regeneration, inhibitory microenvironments, glial scar formation, immunomodulation, and angiogenesis. Additionally, we summarize the latest evidence on the application of BMMSCs in clinical trials and further discuss the challenges and future directions for stem cell therapy in SCI models."
Stem Cell Therapy for Spinal Cord Injury: A Review of Recent Clinical Trials,"Damianakis EI, Benetos IS, Evangelopoulos DS, Kotroni A, Vlamis J, Pneumaticos SG.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a serious medical condition. The search for an effective cure remains a persistent challenge. Current treatments, unfortunately, are unable to sufficiently improve neurological function, often leading to lifelong disability. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effectiveness of stem cell therapy for SCI using canine models. It also explored the optimal protocol for implementing stem cell therapy. A comprehensive search of studies was conducted from 2000 to October 2022. This study focused on five outcomes: motor function score, histopathology, IHC, western blot, and SEP. The results demonstrated a significant improvement in locomotion post-SCI in dogs treated with stem cell therapy. The therapy also led to an average increase of 3.15 points in the Olby score of the treated dogs compared to the control group. These findings highlights stem cell therapy's potential as a promising SCI treatment. The meta-analysis suggests that using bone marrow stem cells, undergoing neural differentiation in vitro, applying a surgical implantation or intrathecal route of administration, associating matrigel in combination with stem cells, and a waiting period of two weeks before starting treatment can enhance SCI treatment effectiveness."
Research on stem cell therapy for spinal cord injury: a bibliometric and visual analysis from 2018-2023,"Liu R, Peng B, Yuan J, Hu J, Yang J, Shan N, Li Q, Zhao B, Xu C, Wang Y.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a complex neuropathological condition that represents a major challenge for clinicians and scientists due to patient's functional dysfunction and paralysis. Several treatments have been proposed including biological factors, drugs and cells administered in various ways. Stem cells arise as good candidates to treat SCI since they are known to secrete neurotrophic factors, improving neuroregeneration, but also due to their role in modulating the inflammatory process, favoring a pro-regenerative status. There are several types of cells that have been tested to treat SCI in experimental and clinical studies, but we still face many unanswered questions; one of them is the type of cells that can offer the best benefits and, also the ideal dose and administration routes. This review aimed to summarize recent research on cell treatment, focusing on current delivery strategies for SCI therapy and their effects in tissue repair and regeneration."
Cell transplantation and secretome based approaches in spinal cord injury regenerative medicine,"Assunção Silva RC, Pinto L, Salgado AJ.","AB  - The incidence and disability rate of spinal cord injury (SCI) worldwide are high, imposing a heavy burden on patients. Considerable research efforts have been directed toward identifying new strategies to effectively treat SCI. Governor Vessel electro-acupuncture (GV-EA), used in traditional Chinese medicine, combines acupuncture with modern electrical stimulation. It has been shown to improve the microenvironment of injured spinal cord (SC) by increasing levels of endogenous neurotrophic factors and reducing inflammation, thereby protecting injured neurons and promoting myelination. In addition, axons extending from transplanted stem cell-derived neurons can potentially bridge the two severed ends of tissues in a transected SC to rebuild neuronal circuits and restore motor and sensory functions. However, every single treatment approach to severe SCI has proven unsatisfactory. Combining different treatments-for example, electro-acupuncture (EA) with adult stem cell transplantation-appears to be a more promising strategy. In this review, we have summarized the recent progress over the past two decades by our team especially in the use of GV-EA for the repair of SCI. By this strategy, we have shown that EA can stimulate the nerve endings of the meningeal branch. This would elicit the dorsal root ganglion neurons to secrete excess amounts of calcitonin gene-related peptide centrally in the SC. The neuropeptide then activates the local cells to secrete neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), which mediates the survival and differentiation of donor stem cells overexpressing the NT-3 receptor, at the injury/graft site of the SC. Increased local production of NT-3 facilitates reconstruction of host neural tissue such as nerve fiber regeneration and myelination. All this events in sequence would ultimately strengthen the cortical motor-evoked potentials and restore the motor function of paralyzed limbs. The information presented herein provides a basis for future studies on the clinical application of GV-EA and adult stem cell transplantation for the treatment of SCI."
Spinal cord ischemia/injury,"Ishikawa T, Suzuki H, Ishikawa K, Yasuda S, Matsui T, Yamamoto M, Kakeda T, Yamamoto S, Owada Y, Yaksh TL.","AB  - BACKGROUND: Considering the limitations of cell therapy, in case of adequate treatment efficacy, conditioned media (CM) may be a desirable alternative to cell therapy. Hence, the present systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cell-derived conditioned media (MSC-CM) in movement resolution following spinal cord injury (SCI) in animal models. METHODS: A comprehensive search in the databases of Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase was completed until the end of March 2021. Animal studies that evaluate the efficacy of MSC-CM on movement resolution following SCI were defined as the inclusion criteria. Lack of an SCI-untreated group, CM derived from a source other than MSC, not assessing motor function, failure to report CM administered dose, a follow-up period of less than 4 weeks, duplicates, and review articles were counted as the exclusion criteria. Final results are presented as overall standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: From the 361 nonduplicate articles, data from 11 articles were entered into the present meta-analysis. The analyses showed that MSC-CM administration in SCI animal models promotes motor recovery (SMD=2.32; 95% CI: 1.55, 3.09; p<0.0001). Subgroup analysis was performed because of the noticeable heterogeneity between the studies (I(2)=80.97%, p<0.0001), depicting that antibiotic administration, delivery amount, delivery type, and follow-up time were the possible sources of heterogeneity. Moreover, multiple meta-regression demonstrated that in cases of delivery amount of more than 120 μL, the efficacy of MSC-CM administration in motor recovery is more than that of delivery amount of less than 120 μL (regression coefficient=3.30; 95% CI: 0.72, 5.89; p=0.019). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of the present study, it can be concluded that MSC-CM administration in SCI models improves motor recovery. The efficacy of this treatment strategy significantly increases at doses higher than 120 μL."
Stem Cell Transplantation: A Promising Therapy for Spinal Cord Injury,"Gong Z, Xia K, Xu A, Yu C, Wang C, Zhu J, Huang X, Chen Q, Li F, Liang C.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a catastrophic event that incurs substantial personal and social costs. The complex pathophysiology associated with SCI often limits the regeneration of nerve tissue at the injured site and leads to permanent nerve damage. With advances in stem cell biology, the field of regenerative medicine offers the hope of solving this challenging problem. Neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) possess nerve regenerative and neuroprotective effects, and transplanting NSPCs in their optimized form into an injured area holds promising therapeutic potential for SCI. In this review, we summarize the advantages and disadvantages of NSPCs derived from different sources while highlighting the utility of NSPCs derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, an NSPC source with superior advantages, according to data from in vivo animal models and the latest clinical trials."
Human embryonic stem cells,"Damdimopoulou P, Rodin S, Stenfelt S, Antonsson L, Tryggvason K, Hovatta O.","AB  - INTRODUCTION: Spinal cord injury (SCI) can lead to severe neurological dysfunction. Despite scientific and medical advances, clinically effective regenerative therapies including stem cells are lacking for SCI. AREAS COVERED: This paper discusses translational challenges related to the safe, effective use of stem cells for SCI, with a focus on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), neural stem cells (NSCs), Schwann cells (SCs), olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We discuss approaches to enhance the efficacy of cell-based strategies by i) addressing patient heterogeneity and enhancing patient selection; ii) selecting cell type, cell source, cell developmental stage, and delivery technique; iii) enhancing graft integration and mitigating immune-mediated graft rejection; and iv) ensuring availability of cells. Additionally, we review strategies to optimize outcomes including combinatorial use of rehabilitation and discuss ways to mitigate potential risks of tumor formation associated with stem cell-based strategies. EXPERT OPINION: Basic science research will drive translational advances to develop stem cell-based therapies for SCI. Genetic, serological, and imaging biomarkers may enable individualization of cell-based treatments. Moreover, combinatorial strategies will be required to enhance graft survival, migration and functional integration, to enable precision-based intervention."
hiPSC-Neural Stem/Progenitor Cell Transplantation Therapy for Spinal Cord Injury,"Du X, Amponsah AE, Kong D, He J, Ma Z, Ma J, Cui H.","AB  - Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) causes irreversible functional loss of the affected population. The incidence of SCI keeps increasing, resulting in huge burden on the society. The pathogenesis of SCI involves neuron death and exotic reaction, which could impede neuron regeneration. In clinic, the limited regenerative capacity of endogenous cells after SCI is a major problem. Recent studies have demonstrated that a variety of stem cells such as induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs), Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs), Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) and Neural Progenitor Cells (NPCs) /Neural Stem Cells (NSCs) have therapeutic potential for SCI. However, the efficacy and safety of these stem cellbased therapy for SCI remain controversial. In this review, we introduce the pathogenesis of SCI, summarize the current status of the application of these stem cells in SCI repair, and discuss possible mechanisms responsible for functional recovery of SCI after stem cell transplantation. Finally, we highlight several areas for further exploitation of stem cells as a promising regenerative therapy of SCI."
Endogenous neural stem cell responses to stroke and spinal cord injury,"Grégoire CA, Goldenstein BL, Floriddia EM, Barnabé-Heider F, Fernandes KJ.","AB  - The establishment of permanent human embryonic stem cell lines (hESCs) was first reported in 1998. Due to their pluripotent nature and ability to differentiate to all cell types in the body, they have been considered as a cell source for regenerative medicine. Since then, intensive studies have been carried out regarding factors regulating pluripotency and differentiation. hESCs are obtained from supernumerary human IVF (in vitro fertilization) embryos that cannot be used for the couple's infertility treatment. Today, we can establish and expand these cells in animal substance-free conditions, even from single cells biopsied from eight-cell stage embryos. There are satisfactory tests for the demonstration of genetic stability, absence of tumorigenic mutations, functionality, and safety of hESCs. Clinical trials are ongoing for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and spinal cord injury (SCI). This review focuses on the present state of these techniques."
Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes: Hope for Spinal Cord Injury Repair,"Ren Z, Qi Y, Sun S, Tao Y, Shi R.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating medical condition with profound social and economic impacts. Although research is ongoing, current treatment options are limited and do little to restore functionality. However, recent studies suggest that mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (MSC-exosomes) may hold the key to exciting new treatment options for SCI patients. MSCs are self-renewing multipotent stem cells with multi-directional differentiation and can secrete a large number of exosomes (vesicles secreted into the extracellular environment through endocytosis, called MSC-exosomes). These MSC-exosomes play a critical role in repairing SCI through promoting angiogenesis and axonal growth, regulating inflammation and the immune response, inhibiting apoptosis, and maintaining the integrity of the blood-spinal cord barrier. Furthermore, they can be utilized to transport genetic material or drugs to target cells, and their relatively small size makes them able to permeate the blood-brain barrier. In this review, we summarize recent advances in MSC-exosome themed SCI treatments and cell-free therapies to better understand this newly emerging methodology."

In the last two decades, after its success in various fields of medicine, stem cell therapy has been investigated in the research field as a potential treatment for SCI. This review focuses on the pathophysiology of SCI, the characteristics of the different stem cell therapies used for its treatment, and the results of these therapies in recently published clinical trials."
Cell therapy for spinal cord injury using induced pluripotent stem cells,"Nagoshi N, Tsuji O, Nakamura M, Okano H.","AB  - Stroke and spinal cord injury (SCI) are among the most frequent causes of central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, affecting millions of people worldwide each year. The personal and financial costs for affected individuals, their families, and the broader communities are enormous. Although the mammalian CNS exhibits little spontaneous regeneration and self-repair, recent discoveries have revealed that subpopulations of glial cells in the adult forebrain subventricular zone and the spinal cord ependymal zone possess neural stem cell properties. These endogenous neural stem cells react to stroke and SCI by contributing a significant number of new neural cells to formation of the glial scar. These findings have raised hopes that new therapeutic strategies can be designed based on appropriate modulation of endogenous neural stem cell responses to CNS injury. Here, we review the responses of forebrain and spinal cord neural stem cells to stroke and SCI, the role of these responses in restricting injury-induced tissue loss, and the possibility of directing these responses to promote anatomical and functional repair of the CNS."
How can clinical safety and efficacy concerns in stem cell therapy for spinal cord injury be overcome?,"Hejrati N, Wong R, Khazaei M, Fehlings MG.","AB  - The axonal growth-restrictive character of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) makes finding a therapeutic strategy a very demanding task, due to the postinjury events impeditive to spontaneous axonal outgrowth and regeneration. Considering SCI pathophysiology complexity, it has been suggested that an effective therapy should tackle all the SCI-related aspects and provide sensory and motor improvement to SCI patients. Thus, the current aim of any therapeutic approach for SCI relies in providing neuroprotection and support neuroregeneration. Acknowledging the current SCI treatment paradigm, cell transplantation is one of the most explored approaches for SCI with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) being in the forefront of many of these. Studies showing the beneficial effects of MSC transplantation after SCI have been proposing a paracrine action of these cells on the injured tissues, through the secretion of protective and trophic factors, rather than attributing it to the action of cells itself. This manuscript provides detailed information on the most recent data regarding the neuroregenerative effect of the secretome of MSCs as a cell-free based therapy for SCI. The main challenge of any strategy proposed for SCI treatment relies in obtaining robust preclinical evidence from in vitro and in vivo models, before moving to the clinics, so we have specifically focused on the available vertebrate and mammal models of SCI currently used in research and how can SCI field benefit from them."
Effects of mesenchymal stem cell transplantation on spinal cord injury patients,"Tahmasebi F, Barati S.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) has limited treatment options for regaining function. Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) show promise owing to their ability to differentiate into multiple cell types, promote nerve cell survival, and modulate inflammation. This review explores ADSC therapy for SCI, focusing on its potential for improving function, preclinical and early clinical trial progress, challenges, and future directions. Preclinical studies have demonstrated ADSC transplantation's effectiveness in promoting functional recovery, reducing cavity formation, and enhancing nerve regrowth and myelin repair. To improve ADSC efficacy, strategies including genetic modification and combination with rehabilitation are being explored. Early clinical trials have shown safety and feasibility, with some suggesting motor and sensory function improvements. Challenges remain for clinical translation, including optimizing cell survival and delivery, determining dosing, addressing tumor formation risks, and establishing standardized protocols. Future research should focus on overcoming these challenges and exploring the potential for combining ADSC therapy with other treatments, including rehabilitation and medication."
The combination of nanoscaffolds and stem cell transplantation: Paving a promising road for spinal cord injury regeneration,"Chen X, Wang Y, Zhou G, Hu X, Han S, Gao J.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI), one of the most devastating traumas, has caused long-term disability in millions of people worldwide. The pathophysiology of SCI primarily occurs in two stages classified as primary injury and secondary injury. Due to the rupture of axons and the apoptosis of neurons, patients lose their motor, sensory, and reflex functions, which also imposes a huge burden on families and society. However, traditional surgery does not facilitate neuronal regeneration. Although neural stem cells (NSCs) have the potential for multidirectional differentiation, the probability of differentiation into neurons and survival are still low. Surprisingly, the unique properties of nanotechnologies enable targeted drug delivery while reducing adverse reactions, assisting NSCs in differentiating into neurons. Here, recent studies on promising nanoscaffolds are highlighted, and their strengths and drawbacks are evaluated. Although the treatment of SCI remains fraught with challenges, the combination of nanoscaffolds and NSCs pave a promising road for SCI regeneration."
Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Therapy in Spinal Cord Injury: Mechanisms and Prospects,"Xie JL, Wang XR, Li MM, Tao ZH, Teng WW, Saijilafu.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) can lead to severe motor and sensory dysfunction, with a high rate of disability and mortality. Due to the complicated pathological process of SCI, there is no effective clinical treatment strategy at present. Although mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are effective in the treatment of SCI, their application is limited by factors such as low survival rate, cell dedifferentiation, tumorigenesis, blood-brain barrier, and immune rejection. Fortunately, there is growing evidence that most of the biological and therapeutic effects of MSCs may be mediated by the release of paracrine factors, which are extracellular vesicles called exosomes. Exosomes are small endosomal vesicles with bilaminar membranes that have recently been recognized as key mediators for communication between cells and tissues through the transfer of proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, cytokines, and growth factors. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (MSC-exos) play a critical role in SCI repair by promoting angiogenesis and axonal growth, regulating inflammation and immune response, inhibiting apoptosis, and maintaining the integrity of the blood-spinal cord barrier. Furthermore, they can be used to transport genetic material or drugs to target cells, and their relatively small size allows them to permeate the blood-brain barrier. Studies have demonstrated that some exosomal miRNAs derived from MSCs play a significant role in the treatment of SCI. In this review, we summarize recent research advances in MSC-exos and exosomal miRNAs in SCI therapy to better understand this emerging cell-free therapeutic strategy and discuss the advantages and challenges of MSC-exos in future clinical applications."
Stem cell based therapies for spinal cord injury,"Muheremu A, Peng J, Ao Q.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a highly debilitating condition that inflicts devastating harm on the lives of affected individuals, underscoring the urgent need for effective treatments. By activating inflammatory cells and releasing inflammatory factors, the secondary injury response creates an inflammatory microenvironment that ultimately determines whether neurons will undergo necrosis or regeneration. In recent years, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have garnered increasing attention for their therapeutic potential in SCI. MSCs not only possess multipotent differentiation capabilities but also have homing abilities, making them valuable as carriers and mediators of therapeutic agents. The inflammatory microenvironment induced by SCI recruits MSCs to the site of injury through the release of various cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and enzymes. However, this mechanism has not been previously reported. Thus, a comprehensive exploration of the molecular mechanisms and cellular behaviors underlying the interplay between the inflammatory microenvironment and MSC homing is crucial. Such insights have the potential to provide a better understanding of how to harness the therapeutic potential of MSCs in treating inflammatory diseases and facilitating injury repair. This review aims to delve into the formation of the inflammatory microenvironment and how it influences the homing of MSCs."
The Efficacy and Safety of Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation for Spinal Cord Injury Patients: A Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review,"Xu P, Yang X.","AB  - INTRODUCTION: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is characterized by serious both motor and sensory disability of the limbs below the injured segment. It is the most traumatic disorder among central nervous system (CNS) conditions which not only leads to psychological and physical harm to patients but also results in a dramatic loss in the life quality. Many efforts have been developed to find a therapeutic approach for SCI; however, an effective treatment has not yet been found. The lack of effective treatment approach and rehabilitation of SCI underscores the need to identify novel approaches. Tissue engineering associated with stem cells has been recently introduced as an effective treatment approaches for traumatic SCI. Although, low survival rates, immune rejection, cell dedifferentiation, and tumorigenicity have been addressed for tissue engineering. Regenerative medicine is an interdisciplinary field developing and applying tissue engineering, stem cell (SC) therapy, and SC-derived extracellular vesicle therapy that aims to provide reliable and safe ways to replace injured tissues and organs. The application of mesenchymal stem cells-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) has recently attracted attention to improve central nervous system dysfunction such as SCI, mainly by promoting neurogenesis and angiogenesis. METHODS: In this review article the latest information of SCI improvement using stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles published data in the Web of Science, Scopus, Science Direct and Pub Med databases were collected. RESULTS: The data collected show that MSC-EVs, including exosomes, alone or in combination with scaffolds can can regenerate the injured nerve in SCI. CONCLUSION: This study summarizes the efficacy of MSC-EVs, including exosomes, alone or in combination with scaffolds in the treatment of SCI and then discusses the therapeutic outcomes observed in SCI experimental models following treatment with MSC-EVs alone or loaded on scaffolds in particular collagen-based scaffolds. HIGHLIGHTS: The pathological process of SCI being very complex.A complete effective strategy has yet to be found for treatment of SCI in human.Exosomes derived-stem cells alone have great potential for the treatment of SCI.Various biocompatible scaffolds are good drug carriers for SCI treatment.Various biocompatible scaffolds are good carriers for exosomes.

Ethical issues in stem cell research,"Lo B, Parham L.","AB  - A spinal cord injury leads to disturbances of sensory and motor signals due to the damage to white matter and myelinated fiber tracts. Moreover, the damage to gray matter causes segmental loss of interneurons of dorsal horn and motoneurons and restricts the therapeutic options. Neuroprotective strategies have the potential to improve the neurological outcome of patients. To achieve this, concerns to anesthetics or analgesics as neuroprotective interventions have been accumulating to explore neuroprotection during perioperative period. This review includes consideration of: 1) basic concepts of the pathophysiological mechanisms following spinal cord injury and 2) anesthetics and analgesics displaying neuroprotective potential. In particular, we review the application of isoflurane as an inhalational neuroprotectant and discuss evidence for the neuroprotection provided by barbiturates. In addition, 3) recent advances in stem cell biology, neural injury and repair, and progress toward the development of neuroprotective and regenerative interventions are the basis for increased optimism."
Regeneration of Spinal Cord Connectivity Through Stem Cell Transplantation and Biomaterial Scaffolds,"Katoh H, Yokota K, Fehlings MG.","AB  - Stem cell research offers great promise for understanding basic mechanisms of human development and differentiation, as well as the hope for new treatments for diseases such as diabetes, spinal cord injury, Parkinson's disease, and myocardial infarction. However, human stem cell (hSC) research also raises sharp ethical and political controversies. The derivation of pluripotent stem cell lines from oocytes and embryos is fraught with disputes about the onset of human personhood. The reprogramming of somatic cells to produce induced pluripotent stem cells avoids the ethical problems specific to embryonic stem cell research. In any hSC research, however, difficult dilemmas arise regarding sensitive downstream research, consent to donate materials for hSC research, early clinical trials of hSC therapies, and oversight of hSC research. These ethical and policy issues need to be discussed along with scientific challenges to ensure that stem cell research is carried out in an ethically appropriate manner. This article provides a critical analysis of these issues and how they are addressed in current policies."

MSC transplants have been studied in early human trials. Whether the animal models represent the human studies is unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis has examined the effects of MSC transplants in human and animal studies. Following searches of PubMed, Clinical Trials and the Cochrane Library, published papers were screened, and data were extracted and analysed. MSC transplantation was associated with significantly improved motor and sensory function in humans, and significantly increased locomotor function in animals. However, there are discrepancies between the studies of human participants and animal models, including timing of MSC transplant post-injury and source of MSCs. Additionally, difficulty in the comparison of functional outcome measures across species limits the predictive nature of the animal research. These findings have been summarised, and recommendations for further research are discussed to better enable the translation of animal models to MSC-based human clinical therapy."
Regulating Endogenous Neural Stem Cell Activation to Promote Spinal Cord Injury Repair,"Gilbert EAB, Lakshman N, Lau KSK, Morshead CM.","AB  - Treatment of spinal cord injury has always been a challenge for clinical practitioners and scientists. The development in stem cell based therapies has brought new hopes to patients with spinal cord injuries. In the last a few decades, a variety of stem cells have been used to treat spinal cord injury in animal experiments and some clinical trials. However, there are many technical and ethical challenges to overcome before this novel therapeutic method can be widely applied in clinical practice. With further research in pluripotent stem cells and combined application of genetic and tissue engineering techniques, stem cell based therapies are bond to play increasingly important role in the management of spinal cord injuries."
Stem Cell Strategies in Promoting Neuronal Regeneration after Spinal Cord Injury: A Systematic Review,"Bonosi L, Silven MP, Biancardino AA, Sciortino A, Giammalva GR, Scerrati A, Sturiale CL, Albanese A, Tumbiolo S, Visocchi M, Iacopino DG, Maugeri R.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a structural event with devastating consequences worldwide. Due to the limited intrinsic regenerative capacity of the spinal cord in adults, the neural restoration after SCI is difficult. Acupuncture is effective for SCI-induced neurologic deficits, and the potential mechanisms responsible for its effects involve neural protection by the inhibition of inflammation, oxidation, and apoptosis. Moreover, acupuncture promotes neural regeneration and axon sprouting by activating multiple cellular signal transduction pathways, such as the Wnt, Notch, and Rho/Rho kinase (ROCK) pathways. Several studies have demonstrated that the efficacy of combining acupuncture with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation is superior to either procedure alone. The advantage of the combined treatment is dependent on the ability of acupuncture to enhance the survival of MSCs, promote their differentiation into neurons, and facilitate targeted migration of MSCs to the spinal cord. Additionally, the differentiation of MSCs into neurons overcomes the problem of the shortage of endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs) in the acupuncture-treated SCI patients. Therefore, the combination of acupuncture and MSCs transplantation could become a novel and effective strategy for the treatment of SCI. Such a possibility needs to be verified by basic and clinical research."
Stem and progenitor cell therapies: recent progress for spinal cord injury repair,"Louro J, Pearse DD.","AB  - Mechanical trauma to the spinal cord is often accompanied by irreversible tissue damage, limited endogenous repair and permanent loss of motor, sensory and autonomic function. The implantation of exogenous cells or the stimulation of endogenous cells, to repopulate and replace or to provide a conducive environment for repair, offers a promising therapeutic direction for overcoming the multitude of obstacles facing successful recovery from spinal cord injury. Although relatively new to the scene of cell based therapies for reparative medicine, stem cells and their progenitors have been labeled as the 'cell of the future' for revolutionizing the treatment of CNS injury and neurodegenerative disorders. The following review examines the different types of stem cells and their progenitors, their utility in experimental models of spinal cord injury and explores the outstanding issues that still need to be addressed before they move towards clinical implementation."
Effects and Mechanisms of Acupuncture Combined with Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation on Neural Recovery after Spinal Cord Injury: Progress and Prospects,"Tang H, Guo Y, Zhao Y, Wang S, Wang J, Li W, Qin S, Gong Y, Fan W, Chen Z, Guo Y, Xu Z, Fang Y.","AB  - The mainstay of treatment for spinal cord injury includes decompressive laminectomy and elevation of mean arterial pressure. However, outcomes often remain poor. Extensive research and ongoing clinical trials seek to design new treatment options for spinal cord injury, including stem cell therapy, scaffolds, brain-spine interfaces, exoskeletons, epidural electrical stimulation, ultrasound, and cerebrospinal fluid drainage. Some of these treatments are targeted at the initial acute window of injury, during which secondary damage occurs; others are designed to help patients living with chronic injuries."
Stem cell/cellular interventions in human spinal cord injury: Is it time to move from guidelines to regulations and legislations? Literature review and Spinal Cord Society position statement,"Chhabra HS, Sarda K, Jotwani G, Gourie-Devi M, Kaptanoglu E, Charlifue S, Yadav SL, Mohapatra B, Srivastava A, Phadke K.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) often leads to severe motor, sensory, and autonomic dysfunction in patients and imposes a huge economic cost to individuals and society. Due to its complicated pathophysiological mechanism, there is not yet an optimal treatment available for SCI. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are promising candidate transplant cells for use in SCI treatment. The multipotency of MSCs, as well as their rich trophic and immunomodulatory abilities through paracrine signaling, are expected to play an important role in neural repair. At the same time, the simplicity of MSCs isolation and culture and the bypassing of ethical barriers to stem cell transplantation make them more attractive. However, the MSCs concept has evolved in a specific research context to encompass different populations of cells with a variety of biological characteristics, and failure to understand this can undermine the quality of research in the field. Here, we review the development of the concept of MSCs in order to clarify misconceptions and discuss the controversy in MSCs neural differentiation. We also summarize a potential role of MSCs in SCI treatment, including their migration and trophic and immunomodulatory effects, and their ability to relieve neuropathic pain, and we also highlight directions for future research."

Current Concepts of Stem Cell Therapy for Chronic Spinal Cord Injury,"Suzuki H, Sakai T.","AB  - For the past few decades, spinal cord injury (SCI) has been believed to be an incurable traumatic condition, but with recent developments in stem cell biology, the field of regenerative medicine has gained hopeful momentum in the development of a treatment for this challenging pathology. Among the treatment candidates, transplantation of neural precursor cells has gained remarkable attention as a reasonable therapeutic intervention to replace the damaged central nervous system cells and promote functional recovery. Here, we highlight transplantation therapy techniques using induced pluripotent stem cells to treat SCI and review the recent research giving consideration to future clinical applications."
Regenerative medicine for spinal cord injury: focus on stem cells and biomaterials,"Papa S, Pizzetti F, Perale G, Veglianese P, Rossi F.","AB  - Despite the vast improvements of cell therapy in spinal cord injury treatment, no optimum protocol has been developed for application of neural stem/progenitor cells. In this regard, the present meta-analysis showed that the efficacy of the neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPC) transplantation depends mainly on injury model, intervention phase, transplanted cell count, immunosuppressive use, and probably stem cell source. Improved functional recovery post NSPC transplantation was found to be higher in transection and contusion models. Moreover, NSPC transplantation in acute phase of spinal injury was found to have better functional recovery. Higher doses (>3×10(6)cell/kg) were also shown to be optimum for transplantation, but immunosuppressive agent administration negatively affected the motor function recovery. Scaffold use in NSPC transplantation could also effectively raise functional recovery."
Stem cells for spinal cord injury: Strategies to inform differentiation and transplantation,"Iyer NR, Wilems TS, Sakiyama-Elbert SE.","AB  - INTRODUCTION: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a dramatic medical pathology consequence of a trauma (primary injury). However, most of the post-traumatic degeneration of the tissue is caused by the so-called secondary injury, which is known to be a multifactorial process. This, indeed, includes a wide spectrum of events: blood-brain barrier dysfunction, local inflammation, neuronal death, demyelination and disconnection of nerve pathways. AREAS COVERED: Cell therapy represents a promising cure to target diseases and disorders at the cellular level, by restoring cell population or using cells as carriers of therapeutic cargo. In particular, regenerative medicine with stem cells represents the most appealing category to be used, thanks to their peculiar features. EXPERT OPINION: Many preclinical research studies demonstrated that cell treatment can improve animal sensory/motor functions and so demonstrated to be very promising for clinical trials. In particular, recent advances have led to the development of biomaterials aiming to promote in situ cell delivery. This review digs into this topic discussing the possibility of cell treatment to improve medical chances in SCI repair."
Regenerative Potential of Stem Cell-derived Extracellular Vesicles in Spinal Cord Injury (SCI),"Herbert FJ, Bharathi D, Suresh S, David E, Kumar S.","AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article provides an update on the acute and subacute management and prognostication of patients with traumatic spinal cord injury. RECENT FINDINGS: Immobilization of the spine and spine clearance should be individualized depending on the ability to perform a reliable neurologic examination, the presence of neck pain, and the imaging findings. Early surgery (within 24 hours) to achieve definitive cord decompression and spine stabilization may be beneficial. Ensuring adequate oxygenation and perfusion and avoiding secondary systemic complications remain the goals of the critical care of these patients. No neuroprotective treatment has been shown to improve outcomes. In fact, the use of high-dose methylprednisolone is now generally discouraged because of its major systemic adverse effects. Survivors of severe cervical traumatic spinal cord injury typically sustain substantial long-term functional impairment. Advances in our understanding of neuroregenerative strategies, especially stem cell transplantation, can offer the future hope of functional improvement to the many patients currently living with the consequences of traumatic spinal cord injury. Yet, at present, these therapies remain strictly investigational. SUMMARY: The treatment of traumatic spinal cord injury remains supportive, and prognosis is still poor for patients who are severely affected. While much remains to be learned about how to optimize the acute management of these patients, future efforts would be most useful if focused on injury prevention and the development of effective neuroregenerative therapies."
Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury,Rabinstein AA.,"AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) affects millions of individuals worldwide. Currently, there is no cure, and treatment options to promote neural recovery are limited. An innovative approach to improve outcomes following SCI involves the recruitment of endogenous populations of neural stem cells (NSCs). NSCs can be isolated from the neuroaxis of the central nervous system (CNS), with brain and spinal cord populations sharing common characteristics (as well as regionally distinct phenotypes). Within the spinal cord, a number of NSC sub-populations have been identified which display unique protein expression profiles and proliferation kinetics. Collectively, the potential for NSCs to impact regenerative medicine strategies hinges on their cardinal properties, including self-renewal and multipotency (the ability to generate de novo neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes). Accordingly, endogenous NSCs could be harnessed to replace lost cells and promote structural repair following SCI. While studies exploring the efficacy of this approach continue to suggest its potential, many questions remain including those related to heterogeneity within the NSC pool, the interaction of NSCs with their environment, and the identification of factors that can enhance their response. We discuss the current state of knowledge regarding populations of endogenous spinal cord NSCs, their niche, and the factors that regulate their behavior. In an attempt to move towards the goal of enhancing neural repair, we highlight approaches that promote NSC activation following injury including the modulation of the microenvironment and parenchymal cells, pharmaceuticals, and applied electrical stimulation."
Spinal Cord Injury Management through the Combination of Stem Cells and Implantable 3D Bioprinted Platforms,"Zarepour A, Hooshmand S, Gökmen A, Zarrabi A, Mostafavi E.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition with a significant medical and socioeconomic impact. To date, no effective treatment is available that can enable neuronal regeneration and recovery of function at the damaged level. This is thought to be due to scar formation, axonal degeneration and a strong inflammatory response inducing a loss of neurons followed by a cascade of events that leads to further spinal cord damage. Many experimental studies demonstrate the therapeutic effect of stem cells in SCI due to their ability to differentiate into neuronal cells and release neurotrophic factors. Therefore, it appears to be a valid strategy to use in the field of regenerative medicine. This review aims to provide an up-to-date summary of the current research status, challenges, and future directions for stem cell therapy in SCI models, providing an overview of this constantly evolving and promising field."
Immunosuppressive mechanisms for stem cell transplant survival in spinal cord injury,"Antonios JP, Farah GJ, Cleary DR, Martin JR, Ciacci JD, Pham MH.","AB  - Chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a catastrophic condition associated with significant neurological deficit and social and financial burdens. It is currently being managed symptomatically with no real therapeutic strategies available. In recent years, a number of innovative regenerative strategies have emerged and have been continuously investigated in clinical trials. In addition, several more are coming down the translational pipeline. Among ongoing and completed trials are those reporting the use of mesenchymal stem cells, neural stem/progenitor cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, olfactory ensheathing cells, and Schwann cells. The advancements in stem cell technology, combined with the powerful neuroimaging modalities, can now accelerate the pathway of promising novel therapeutic strategies from bench to bedside. Various combinations of different molecular therapies have been combined with supportive scaffolds to facilitate favorable cell-material interactions. In this review, we summarized some of the most recent insights into the preclinical and clinical studies using stem cells and other supportive drugs to unlock the microenvironment in chronic SCI to treat patients with this condition. Successful future therapies will require these stem cells and other synergistic approaches to address the persistent barriers to regeneration, including glial scarring, loss of structural framework, and immunorejection."
Stem cell-derived exosomes as a cell free therapy against spinal cord injury,Khalatbary AR.,"AB  - The complex pathology of spinal cord injury (SCI), involving a cascade of secondary events and the formation of inhibitory barriers, hampers regeneration across the lesion site and often results in irreversible loss of motor function. The limited regenerative capacity of endogenous cells after SCI has led to a focus on the development of cell therapies that can confer both neuroprotective and neuroregenerative benefits. Stem cells have emerged as a candidate cell source because of their ability to self-renew and differentiate into a multitude of specialized cell types. While ethical and safety concerns impeded the use of stem cells in the past, advances in isolation and differentiation methods have largely mitigated these issues. A confluence of work in stem cell biology, genetics, and developmental neurobiology has informed the directed differentiation of specific spinal cell types. After transplantation, these stem cell-derived populations can replace lost cells, provide trophic support, remyelinate surviving axons, and form relay circuits that contribute to functional recovery. Further refinement of stem cell differentiation and transplantation methods, including combinatorial strategies that involve biomaterial scaffolds and drug delivery, is critical as stem cell-based treatments enter clinical trials.

Therapeutically targeting astrocytes with stem and progenitor cell transplantation following traumatic spinal cord injury,"Falnikar A, Li K, Lepore AC.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating disease, with a high rate of disability. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to comprehensively assess the efficacy and safety of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in treating clinical SCI patients. We systematically searched the PUBMED, EMBASE, Chinese Biomedical (CBM), Web of Science and Cochrane databases using the strategy of combination of free-text words and MeSH terms. The indicators of the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale (AIS)-grading improvement rate and adverse effects were displayed with an overall relative risk (RR). For the continuous variables of the ASIA motor score, light-touch score, pinprick score, activities of daily living (ADL) score, and residual urine volume, we used odds ratio (OR) to analyze the data. Eleven studies comprising 499 patients meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria were included. No serious heterogeneity or publication bias was observed across each study. The results showed that significant improvements of total AIS grade (RR: 3.70; P < 0.001), AIS grade A (RR: 3.57; P < 0.001), ASIA sensory score (OR: 8.63; P < 0.001) and reduction of residual urine volume (OR: -36.37; P = 0.03) were observed in experimental group compared with control group. However, no significant differences of motor score (OR: 1.37, P = 0.19) and ADL score (OR: 2.61, P = 0.27) were observed between experimental and control groups. In addition, there were no serious and permanent adverse effects after cell transplantation. Cell transplantation with MSCs is effective and safe in improving the sensory and bladder functions of SCI patients."
Adipose-Derived Stem Cell Therapy in Spinal Cord Injury,"El Masri J, Fadlallah H, Al Sabsabi R, Afyouni A, Al-Sayegh M, Abou-Kheir W.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) has a major impact on affected patients due to its pathological consequences and absence of capacity for self-repair. Currently available therapies are unable to restore lost neural functions. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop novel treatments that will promote functional repair after SCI. Several experimental approaches have been explored to tackle SCI, including the combination of stem cells and 3D bioprinting. Implanted multipotent stem cells with self-renewing capacity and the ability to differentiate to a diversity of cell types are promising candidates for replacing dead cells in injured sites and restoring disrupted neural circuits. However, implanted stem cells need protection from the inflammatory agents in the injured area and support to guide them to appropriate differentiation. Not only are 3D bioprinted scaffolds able to protect stem cells, but they can also promote their differentiation and functional integration at the site of injury. In this review, we showcase some recent advances in the use of stem cells for the treatment of SCI, different types of 3D bioprinting methods, and the combined application of stem cells and 3D bioprinting technique for effective repair of SCI."

It was subsequently established that these beneficial effects may be mediated through release of paracrine factors, a kind of extracellular vesicle known as exosomes. Stem cell-secreted nano-sized exosomes have shown great potential to reduce apoptosis and inflammation, enhance angiogenesis, and improve functional behavioral recovery following spinal cord injury. This review summarizes current knowledge about the influence of exosomes derived from stem cells on spinal cord protection and regeneration with their molecular mechanisms after injury."
Molecular Mechanisms and Clinical Application of Multipotent Stem Cells for Spinal Cord Injury,"Szymoniuk M, Litak J, Sakwa L, Dryla A, Zezuliński W, Czyżewski W, Kamieniak P, Blicharski T.","AB  - Replacement of lost and/or dysfunctional astrocytes via multipotent neural stem cell (NSC) and lineage-restricted neural progenitor cell (NPC) transplantation is a promising therapeutic approach for traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). Cell transplantation in general offers the potential to replace central nervous system (CNS) cell types, achieve remyelination, deliver missing gene products, promote and guide axonal growth, modulate the host immune response, deliver neuroprotective factors, and provide a cellular substrate for bridging the lesion site, amongst other possible benefits. A host of cell types that differ in their developmental stage, CNS region and species of derivation, as well as in their phenotypic potential, have been tested in a variety of SCI animal models. Historically in the SCI field, most pre-clinical NSC and NPC transplantation studies have focused on neuronal and oligodendrocyte replacement. However, much less attention has been geared towards targeting astroglial dysfunction in the inured spinal cord, despite the integral roles played by astrocytes in both normal CNS function and in the diseased nervous system. Despite the relative lack of studies, cell transplantation-based targeting of astrocytes dates back to some of the earliest transplant studies in SCI animal models. In this review, we will describe the history of work involving cell transplantation for targeting astrocytes in models of SCI. We will also touch on the current state of affairs in the field, as well as on important future directions as we move forward in trying to develop this approach into a viable strategy for SCI patients. Practical issues such as timing of delivery, route of transplantation and immunesuppression needs are beyond the scope of this review.

Research progress and prospects of benefit-risk assessment methods for umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell transplantation in the clinical treatment of spinal cord injury,"Shen R, Lu Y, Cai C, Wang Z, Zhao J, Wu Y, Zhang Y, Yang Y.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition that causes substantial morbidity and mortality and for which no treatments are available. Stem cells offer some promise in the restoration of neurological function. We used systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression to study the impact of stem cell biology and experimental design on motor and sensory outcomes following stem cell treatments in animal models of SCI. One hundred and fifty-six publications using 45 different stem cell preparations met our prespecified inclusion criteria. Only one publication used autologous stem cells. Overall, allogeneic stem cell treatment appears to improve both motor (effect size, 27.2%; 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 25.0%-29.4%; 312 comparisons in 5,628 animals) and sensory (effect size, 26.3%; 95% CI, 7.9%-44.7%; 23 comparisons in 473 animals) outcome. For sensory outcome, most heterogeneity between experiments was accounted for by facets of stem cell biology. Differentiation before implantation and intravenous route of delivery favoured better outcome. Stem cell implantation did not appear to improve sensory outcome in female animals and appeared to be enhanced by isoflurane anaesthesia. Biological plausibility was supported by the presence of a dose-response relationship. For motor outcome, facets of stem cell biology had little detectable effect. Instead most heterogeneity could be explained by the experimental modelling and the outcome measure used. The location of injury, method of injury induction, and presence of immunosuppression all had an impact. Reporting of measures to reduce bias was higher than has been seen in other neuroscience domains but were still suboptimal. Motor outcomes studies that did not report the blinded assessment of outcome gave inflated estimates of efficacy. Extensive recent preclinical literature suggests that stem-cell-based therapies may offer promise, however the impact of compromised internal validity and publication bias mean that efficacy is likely to be somewhat lower than reported here."
Unlocking the paradoxical endogenous stem cell response after spinal cord injury,"Hachem LD, Mothe AJ, Tator CH.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a complex tissue injury that results in a wide range of physical deficits, including permanent or progressive disabilities of sensory, motor and autonomic functions. To date, limitations in current clinical treatment options can leave SCI patients with lifelong disabilities. There is an urgent need to develop new therapies for reconstructing the damaged spinal cord neuron-glia network and restoring connectivity with the supraspinal pathways. Neural stem cells (NSCs) possess the ability to self-renew and differentiate into neurons and neuroglia, including oligodendrocytes, which are cells responsible for the formation and maintenance of the myelin sheath and the regeneration of demyelinated axons. For these properties, NSCs are considered to be a promising cell source for rebuilding damaged neural circuits and promoting myelin regeneration. Over the past decade, transplantation of NSCs has been extensively tested in a variety of preclinical models of SCI. This review aims to highlight the pathophysiology of SCI and promote the understanding of the role of NSCs in SCI repair therapy and the current advances in pathological mechanism, pre-clinical studies, as well as clinical trials of SCI via NSC transplantation therapeutic strategy.

Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies for Cervical Spinal Cord Injury,"Doulames VM, Plant GW.","AB  - Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) is a common neurological disorder with devastating psychical and psychosocial sequelae. The majority of patients after SCI suffer from permanent disability caused by motor dysfunction, impaired sensation, neuropathic pain, spasticity as well as urinary complications, and a small number of patients experience a complete recovery. Current standard treatment modalities of the SCI aim to prevent secondary injury and provide limited recovery of lost neurological functions. Stem Cell Therapy (SCT) represents an emerging treatment approach using the differentiation, paracrine, and self-renewal capabilities of stem cells to regenerate the injured spinal cord. To date, multipotent stem cells including mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), neural stem cells (NSCs), and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) represent the most investigated types of stem cells for the treatment of SCI in preclinical and clinical studies. The microenvironment of SCI has a significant impact on the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of transplanted stem cells. Therefore, a deep understanding of the pathophysiology of SCI and molecular mechanisms through which stem cells act may help improve the treatment efficacy of SCT and find new therapeutic approaches such as stem-cell-derived exosomes, gene-modified stem cells, scaffolds, and nanomaterials. In this literature review, the pathogenesis of SCI and molecular mechanisms of action of multipotent stem cells including MSCs, NSCs, and HSCs are comprehensively described. Moreover, the clinical efficacy of multipotent stem cells in SCI treatment, an optimal protocol of stem cell administration, and recent therapeutic approaches based on or combined with SCT are also discussed."
Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Transplantation Improves Locomotor Recovery in Rat Models of Spinal Cord Injury: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials,"Qin C, Guo Y, Yang DG, Yang ML, Du LJ, Li JJ.","AB  - Spinal cord injury is a devastating condition that is critically challenging and progressive, needing immediate medical attention due to its complex pathophysiology and affecting the social status and economic burden. Stem cell therapy has been the emerging therapeutic trend to treat various diseases for decades. Mesenchymal stem cells pose more advantages over other stem cells in immune-modulation, immune evasiveness, self-renewal, multipotency, etc. Due to various issues in the recent past related to allogenic transplants, ethical concerns in obtaining tissues and adult cells, host immune response, GMP grade production and certification, cell-derived products or cell secretome have proven to be a promising approach and have been implicated in many studies and also in many clinical trials. Utilization of these human MSC-derived exosomes/extracellular vesicles in spinal cord injury has also been demonstrated in many pre-clinical animal models. It is now proven to be therapeutically more efficient and safer than cell therapy.

Structure-function Evaluation of Stem Cell Therapies for Spinal Cord Injury,Zhang F.,"AB  - Nearly a century ago, the concept of the secondary injury in spinal cord trauma was first proposed to explain the complex cascade of molecular and cellular events leading to widespread neuronal and glial cell death after trauma. In recent years, it has been established that the ependymal region of the adult mammalian spinal cord contains a population of multipotent neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) that are activated after spinal cord injury (SCI) and likely play a key role in endogenous repair and regeneration. How these cells respond to the various components of the secondary injury remains poorly understood. Emerging evidence suggests that many of the biochemical components of the secondary injury cascade which have classically been viewed as deleterious to host neuronal and glial cells may paradoxically trigger NSPC activation, proliferation, and differentiation thus challenging our current understanding of secondary injury mechanisms in SCI. Herein, we highlight new findings describing the response of endogenous NSPCs to spinal cord trauma, redefining the secondary mechanisms of SCI through the lens of the endogenous population of stem/progenitor cells. Moreover, we outline how these insights can fuel novel stem cell-based therapeutic strategies to repair the injured spinal cord."

Stem Cells and Labeling for Spinal Cord Injury,"Gazdic M, Volarevic V, Arsenijevic A, Erceg S, Moreno-Manzano V, Arsenijevic N, Stojkovic M.","AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Spinal cord injury (SCI) has long been a subject of great interest in a wide range of scientific fields. Several attempts have been made to demonstrate motor function improvement in rats with SCI after transplantation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). This systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to summarize the effects of iPSC on locomotor recovery in rat models of SCI. METHODS: We searched the publications in the PubMed, Medline, Science Citation Index, Cochrane Library, CNKI, and Wan-fang databases and the China Biology Medicine disc. Results were analyzed by Review Manager 5.3.0. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. RESULTS: Six randomized controlled preclinical trials covering eight comparisons and including 212 rats were selected. The subgroup analyses were based on the following items: different SCI models, cell counts, iPSC sources, iPSC differentiations and transplantation methods. The pooled results indicated that iPSC transplantation significantly improved locomotor recovery of rats after SCI by sustaining beneficial effects, especially in the subgroups of contusion, moderate cell counts (5×105), source of human fetal lung fibroblasts, iPSC-neural precursors and intraspinal injection. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis of the effects of iPSC transplantation on locomotor function in SCI models is, to our knowledge, the first meta-analysis in this field. We conclude that iPSC transplantation improves locomotor recovery in rats with SCI, implicating this strategy as an effective therapy. However, more studies are required to validate our conclusions."
Current Concept of Stem Cell Therapy for Spinal Cord Injury: A Review,"Oh SK, Jeon SR.","AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinal cord injuries (SCI) are prevalent, devastating for quality and expectancy of life, and cause heavy economic burdens. Stem cell therapies hold promise in complete structural and functional restoration of SCI. OBJECTIVE: This review focuses on the methods currently used to evaluate the stem cell therapies for SCI. RESULTS: Various kinds of stem cells involving embryonic stem cells (ESCs), bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), neural stem cells (NSCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are extensively used in regenerative research of SCI. For evaluation, the survival and integration of transplanted cells, spinal cord reconstruction and functional recovery all should be considered. Histological and histochemistrical, microscopic, and colorimetric assays, and real-time RT-PCR techniques are applied to determine the outcome. From the three main aspects-transplanted cells, spinal cord structure, and functional recovery-we summarize and discuss these methods with certain instances of applications in SCI models. Importantly, for the evaluations of function, neuronal transmitting, electrophysiological analysis and behavioral score are included. CONCLUSION: Wider conjunction of established technologies, as well as the further development of nondestructive methods might make a big difference in testing stem cell therapies."
Influential factors on stem cell therapy success in canine model of spinal cord Injury: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Dadvand A, Yavari A, Teimourpour A, Farzad-Mohajeri S.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a serious condition caused by damage to the spinal cord through trauma or disease, often with permanent debilitating effects. Globally, the prevalence of SCI is estimated between 40 to 80 cases per million people per year. Patients with SCI can experience devastating health and socioeconomic consequences from paralysis, which is a loss of motor, sensory and autonomic nerve function below the level of the injury that often accompanies SCI. SCI carries a high mortality and increased risk of premature death due to secondary complications. The health, social and economic consequences of SCI are significant, and therefore elucidation of the complex molecular processes that occur in SCI and development of novel effective treatments is critical. Despite advances in medicine for the SCI patient such as surgery and anaesthesiology, imaging, rehabilitation and drug discovery, there have been no definitive findings toward complete functional neurologic recovery. However, the advent of neural stem cell therapy and the engineering of functionalized biomaterials to facilitate cell transplantation and promote regeneration of damaged spinal cord tissue presents a potential avenue to advance SCI research. This review will explore this emerging field and identify new lines of research."

In this context, there is a mandatory need for novel adjunctive therapeutic approaches to classical treatments to improve rehabilitation chances and clinical outcomes. This review offers a new and original perspective on therapies targeting the microglia, one of the most relevant immune cells implicated in spinal cord disorders. The first part of the manuscript reviews the anatomical and pathophysiological importance of the blood-spinal cord barrier components, including the role of microglia in post-acute neuroinflammation. Subsequently, the authors present the emerging therapies based on microglia modulation, such as cytokines modulators, stem cell, microRNA, and nanoparticle-based treatments that could positively impact spinal cord injury management. Finally, future perspectives and challenges are also highlighted based on the ongoing clinical trials related to medications targeting microglia."
Molecular imaging in stem cell therapy for spinal cord injury,"Song F, Tian M, Zhang H.","AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature of spinal cord injury and stem cell therapy for large animal models and incorporate those results into an understanding of stem cell therapy for human cord injury. METHODS: Review of the literature. RESULTS: Eleven canine studies were identified and 3 sub-human primate studies were identified showing variable results. CONCLUSIONS: Stem cell therapy is a promising therapeutic option for patients with spinal cord injury; however, the technology has many un-answered questions and further research is needed."
Autophagy regulation combined with stem cell therapy for treatment of spinal cord injury,"Shen Y, Wang YP, Cheng X, Yang X, Wang G.","AB  - Cervical-level injuries account for the majority of presented spinal cord injuries (SCIs) to date. Despite the increase in survival rates due to emergency medicine improvements, overall quality of life remains poor, with patients facing variable deficits in respiratory and motor function. Therapies aiming to ameliorate symptoms and restore function, even partially, are urgently needed. Current therapeutic avenues in SCI seek to increase regenerative capacities through trophic and immunomodulatory factors, provide scaffolding to bridge the lesion site and promote regeneration of native axons, and to replace SCI-lost neurons and glia via intraspinal transplantation. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a clinically viable means to accomplish this; they have no major ethical barriers, sources can be patient-matched and collected using non-invasive methods. In addition, the patient's own cells can be used to establish a starter population capable of producing multiple cell types. To date, there is only a limited pool of research examining iPSC-derived transplants in SCI-even less research that is specific to cervical injury. The purpose of the review herein is to explore both preclinical and clinical recent advances in iPSC therapies with a detailed focus on cervical spinal cord injury."
Applications of induced pluripotent stem cell technologies in spinal cord injury,"Nagoshi N, Okano H.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) has been associated with a dismal prognosis-recovery is not expected, and the most standard interventions have been temporizing measures that do little to mitigate the extent of damage. While advances in surgical and medical techniques have certainly improved this outlook, limitations in functional recovery continue to impede clinically significant improvements. These limitations are dependent on evolving immunological mechanisms that shape the cellular environment at the site of SCI. In this review, we examine these mechanisms, identify relevant cellular components, and discuss emerging treatments in stem cell grafts and adjuvant immunosuppressants that target these pathways. As the field advances, we expect that stem cell grafts and these adjuvant treatments will significantly shift therapeutic approaches to acute SCI with the potential for more promising outcomes."
Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles: emerging concepts in the treatment of spinal cord injury,"Wang S, Du C, Li G.","AB  - BACKGROUND: Stem cell sheet implantation offers a promising avenue for spinal cord injury (SCI) and is currently under investigation in pre-clinical in vivo studies. Nevertheless, a systematic review of the relevant literature is yet to be performed. Thus, this systematic review aims to explore the efficacy of stem cell sheet technology in treating SCI, as indicated by experimental animal model studies. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. Manuscripts that did not pertain to in vivo pre-clinical studies and those published in non-English languages were excluded. A risk assessment for bias was performed using the SYRCLE tool. Extracted data were synthesized only qualitatively because the data were not suitable for conducting the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Among the 847 studies retrieved from electronic database searches, seven met the inclusion criteria. Six of these studies employed a complete transection model, while one utilized a compression model. Stem cell sources included bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth, and adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells. In all included studies, stem cell sheet application significantly improved motor and sensory functional scores compared to intreated SCI rats. This functional recovery correlated with histological improvements at the injury site. All studies are at low risk of bias but certain domains were not reported by some or all of the studies. CONCLUSION: The results of our systematic review suggest that stem cell sheets may be a feasible therapeutic approach for the treatment of SCI. Future research should be conducted on stem cell sheets in various animal models and types of SCI, and careful validation is necessary before translating stem cell sheets into clinical studies."

Spinal Cord Injury: Emerging Technologies,"Hersh AM, Weber-Levine C, Jiang K, Theodore N.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is damage to the spinal cord that permanently or temporarily disrupts its function, causing considerable autonomic, sensory, and motor disorders, and involves between 10 and 83 cases per million yearly. Traumatic SCI happens following primary acute mechanical damage, leading to injury to the spinal cord tissue and worsening clinical outcomes. The present therapeutic strategies for this complex disease fundamentally rely on surgical approaches and conservative remedies. However, these modalities are not effective enough for neurological recovery. Therefore, it is necessary to discover more efficient methods to treat patients with SCI. Today, considerable attention has been drawn to bioactive compounds-based remedies and stem cell therapy for curing various ailments and disorders, such as neurological diseases. Some researchers have recommended that harnessing curcumin, a polyphenol obtained from turmeric, in combination with stem cells, like mesenchymal stem cells, neural stem cells, and ependymal stem cells, can remarkably improve neurological recovery-related parameters more effective than the treatment with these two methods separately in experimental models. Hereby, this literature review delves into the functionality of curcumin combined with stem cells in treating SCI with a focus on cellular and molecular mechanisms."
Application of stem cells and chitosan in the repair of spinal cord injury,"Hu X, Zhou X, Li Y, Jin Q, Tang W, Chen Q, Aili D, Qian H.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a prevalent central nervous system disease with a high disability rate, leading to the loss of motor and sensory nerve function. Due to the complex pathophysiology of SCI, more effective clinical treatment strategies are needed. Research has indicated the considerable potential of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-EVs) as a cell-free therapy in SCI repair and regeneration due to their ability to regulate immune cell activity and stimulate damaged neuron regeneration. Moreover, applying MSCs and engineered EVs can fully exploit the potential of MSC-EVs in spinal cord repair. Here, we outline the pathological process of SCI and its current clinical treatment status, summarize the latest MSC-EVs research and its pretreatment and engineering strategies in SCI treatment, and explore MSC-EVs application prospects."
Axonal growth and connectivity from neural stem cell grafts in models of spinal cord injury,"Lu P, Kadoya K, Tuszynski MH.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a catastrophic condition associated with significant neurological deficit, social, and financial burdens. Over the past decades, various treatments including medication, surgery, and rehabilitation therapy for SCI have been performed, but there were no definite treatment option to improve neurological function of patients with chronic SCI. Therefore, new treatment trials with stem cells have been studied to regenerate injured spinal cord. Among various types of stem cells, bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells is highly expected as candidates for the stem cell therapy. The result of the current research showed that direct intramedullary injection to the injured spinal cord site in subacute phase is most effective. Neurological examination, electrophysiologic studies, and magnetic resonance imaging are commonly used to assess the effectiveness of treatment. Diffusion tensor imaging visualizing white matter tract can be also alternative option to identify neuronal regeneration. Despite various challenging issues, stem cell therapy will open new perspectives for SCI treatment."
Stem cells and spinal cord injury repair,"Karimi-Abdolrezaee S, Eftekharpour E.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is associated with substantial healthcare challenges, frequently resulting in enduring sensory and motor deficits alongside various chronic complications. While advanced regenerative therapies have shown promise in preclinical research, their translation into clinical application has been limited. In response, this study utilized a comprehensive network meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPC) transplantation across animal models of SCI. We analyzed 363 outcomes from 55 distinct studies, categorizing the treatments into NSPCs alone (cell only), NSPCs with scaffolds (cell + scaffold), NSPCs with hydrogels (cell + hydrogel), standalone scaffolds (scaffold), standalone hydrogels (hydrogel), and control groups. Our analysis demonstrated significant enhancements in motor recovery, especially in gait function, within the NSPC treatment groups. Notably, the cell only group showed considerable improvements (standardized mean difference [SMD], 2.05; 95 % credible interval [CrI]: 1.08 to 3.10, p < 0.01), as did the cell + scaffold group (SMD, 3.73; 95 % CrI: 2.26 to 5.22, p < 0.001) and the cell + hydrogel group (SMD, 3.37; 95 % CrI: 1.02 to 5.78, p < 0.05) compared to controls. These therapeutic combinations not only reduced lesion cavity size but also enhanced neuronal regeneration, outperforming the cell only treatments. By integrating NSPCs with supportive biomaterials, our findings pave the way for refining these regenerative strategies to optimize their potential in clinical SCI treatment. Although there is no overall violation of consistency, the comparison of effect sizes between individual treatments should be interpreted in light of the inconsistency. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This study presents a comprehensive network meta-analysis exploring the efficacy of neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation, with and without biomaterials, in animal models of spinal cord injury (SCI). We demonstrate that NSCs, particularly when combined with biomaterials like scaffolds or hydrogels, significantly enhance motor and histological recovery post-SCI. These findings underscore the potential of NSC-based therapies, augmented with biomaterials, to advance SCI treatment, offering new insights into regenerative strategies that could significantly impact clinical practices."
Stem cell-based therapy for spinal cord injury,"Volarevic V, Erceg S, Bhattacharya SS, Stojkovic P, Horner P, Stojkovic M.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition that usually results in sudden and long-lasting locomotor and sensory neuron degeneration below the lesion site. During the last two decades, the search for new therapies has been revolutionized with the improved knowledge of stem cell (SC) biology. SCs therapy offers several attractive strategies for spinal cord repair. The transplantation of SCs promotes remyelination, neurite outgrowth and axonal elongation, and activates resident or transplanted progenitor cells across the lesion cavity. However, optimized growth and differentiation protocols along with reliable safety assays should be established prior to the clinical application of SCs. Additionally, the ideal method of SCs labeling for efficient cell tracking after SCI remains a challenging issue that requires further investigation. This review summarizes the current findings on the SCs-based therapeutic strategies, and compares different SCs labeling approaches for SCI."
Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem cell therapies for spinal cord injury,"Lee-Kubli CA, Lu P.","AB  - Spinal cord injury is a lesion with high mortality and significant morbidities. After the primary injury, during six months, a cascade of secondary cellular and molecular events makes the lesion chronic. Recently, cell-based clinical trials as a new procedure have been gradually tested to improve the symptoms of patients. Each treatment method is associated with different adverse events. Based on the PRISMA flow diagram of the identified records, and after multistep screening, finally in 76 reviewed studies with 1633 cases and 189 controls, 64 types of adverse events in 12 categories were recorded in 45 studies. The most common adverse events were transient backache and meningism (90%) and cord malacia (80%). The cell therapy method in which the treatment was associated with more adverse events was Olfactory ensheathing cell and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell combination therapy in 55%, and the adverse events were less with the embryonic stem cell in 2.33% of patients. In a meta-analysis, the total prevalence of adverse events in cell therapy was 19% and the highest pulled effect size belonged to urinary tract and localized adverse events. Also, the total prevalence of adverse events in 14 cell therapy methods was 18% and four cell types (neural stem cell, bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell, embryonic stem cell, and umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell) had the most effect. None of the adverse events were reported on the 4 (life-threatening consequences) and 5 (death) grading scales. We concluded that the frequency of life-threatening adverse events following cell therapy clinical trials in chronic spinal cord injury patients is very scarce and can be ignored."
Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Exosomal MiRNAs Promote M2 Macrophages Polarization: Therapeutic Opportunities for Spinal Cord Injury,"Liang ZY, Xu XJ, Rao J, Yang ZL, Wang CH, Chen CM.","AB  - Numerous basic research studies have suggested the potential efficacy of neural precursor cell (NPC) transplantation in spinal cord injury (SCI). However, in most such studies, the origin of the cells used was mainly fetal tissue or embryonic stem cells, both of which carry potential ethical concerns with respect to clinical use. The development of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) opened a new path toward regenerative medicine for SCI. iPSCs can be generated from somatic cells by induction of transcription factors, and induced to differentiate into NPCs with characteristics of cells of the central nervous system. The beneficial effect of iPSC-derived NPC transplantation has been reported from our group and others working in rodent and non-human primate models. These promising results facilitate the application of iPSCs for clinical applications in SCI patients. However, iPSCs also have issues, such as genetic/epigenetic abnormalities and tumorigenesis because of the artificial induction method, that must be addressed prior to clinical use. The selection of somatic cells, generation of integration-free iPSCs, and characterization of differentiated NPCs with thorough quality management are all needed to address these potential risks. To enhance the efficacy of the transplanted iPSC-NPCs, especially at chronic phase of SCI, administration of a chondroitinase or semaphorin3A inhibitor represents a potentially important means of promoting axonal regeneration through the lesion site. The combined use of rehabilitation with such cell therapy approaches is also important, as repetitive training enhances neurite outgrowth of transplanted cells and strengthens neural circuits at central pattern generators. Our group has already evaluated clinical grade iPSC-derived NPCs, and we look forward to initiating clinical testing as the next step toward determining whether this approach is safe and effective for clinical use.

Bladder recovery by stem cell based cell therapy in the bladder dysfunction induced by spinal cord injury: systematic review and meta-analysis,"Kim JH, Shim SR, Doo SW, Yang WJ, Yoo BW, Kim JM, Ko YM, Song ES, Lim IS, Lee HJ, Song YS.","AB  - Neglected for years, astrocytes are now recognized to fulfill and support many, if not all, homeostatic functions of the healthy central nervous system (CNS). During neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal cord injury (SCI), astrocytes in the vicinity of degenerating areas undergo both morphological and functional changes that might compromise their intrinsic properties. Evidence from human and animal studies show that deficient astrocyte functions or loss-of-astrocytes largely contribute to increased susceptibility to cell death for neurons, oligodendrocytes and axons during ALS and SCI disease progression. Despite exciting advances in experimental CNS repair, most of current approaches that are translated into clinical trials focus on the replacement or support of spinal neurons through stem cell transplantation, while none focus on the specific replacement of astroglial populations. Knowing the important functions carried out by astrocytes in the CNS, astrocyte replacement-based therapies might be a promising approach to alleviate overall astrocyte dysfunction, deliver neurotrophic support to degenerating spinal tissue and stimulate endogenous CNS repair abilities. Enclosed in this review, we gathered experimental evidence that argue in favor of astrocyte transplantation during ALS and SCI. Based on their intrinsic properties and according to the cell type transplanted, astrocyte precursors or stem cell-derived astrocytes promote axonal growth, support mechanisms and cells involved in myelination, are able to modulate the host immune response, deliver neurotrophic factors and provide protective molecules against oxidative or excitotoxic insults, amongst many possible benefits. Embryonic or adult stem cells can even be genetically engineered in order to deliver missing gene products and therefore maximize the chance of neuroprotection and functional recovery. However, before broad clinical translation, further preclinical data on safety, reliability and therapeutic efficiency should be collected. Although several technical challenges need to be overcome, we discuss the major hurdles that have already been met or solved by targeting the astrocyte population in experimental ALS and SCI models and we discuss avenues for future directions based on latest molecular findings regarding astrocyte biology."
Stem cell therapies for spinal cord injury,"Sahni V, Kessler JA.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI), which has no current cure, places a severe burden on patients. Stem cell-based therapies are considered promising in attempts to repair injured spinal cords; such options include neural stem cells (NSCs). NSCs are multipotent stem cells that differentiate into neuronal and neuroglial lineages. This feature makes NSCs suitable candidates for regenerating injured spinal cords. Many studies have revealed the therapeutic potential of NSCs. In this review, we discuss from an integrated view how NSCs can help SCI repair. We will discuss the sources and therapeutic potential of NSCs, as well as representative pre-clinical studies and clinical trials of NSC-based therapies for SCI repair."

To date, clinical therapies for debilitating SCI are largely ineffective. However, emerging research evidence suggests that repair of SCI can be promoted by stem cell-based therapies in regenerative medicine. Over the past decade, therapeutic potential of different types of stem cells for the treatment of SCI have been investigated in preclinical models. These studies have revealed multiple beneficial roles by which stem cells can improve the outcomes of SCI. This chapter will summarize the recent advances in the application of stem cells in regenerative medicine for the repair of SCI."
Stem cell biology and its therapeutic applications in the setting of spinal cord injury,"Bambakidis NC, Butler J, Horn EM, Wang X, Preul MC, Theodore N, Spetzler RF, Sonntag VK.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating injury that causes permanent neurological dysfunction. To develop a new treatment strategy for SCI, a clinical trial of transplantation of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural precursor cells (NPCs) in patients in the subacute phase of SCI was recently initiated. The formation of synaptic connections with host neural tissues is one of the therapeutic mechanisms of cell transplantation, and this beneficial efficacy has been directly demonstrated using a chemogenetic tool. This research focuses on the establishment of cell therapy for chronic SCI, which is more challenging owing to cavity and scar formation. Thus, neurogenic NPC transplantation is more effective in forming functional synapses with the host neurons. Furthermore, combinatory rehabilitation therapy is useful to enhance the efficacy of this strategy, and a valid rehabilitative training program has been established for SCI animal models that received NPC transplantation in the chronic phase. Therefore, the use of regenerative medicine for chronic SCI is expected to increase."
Stem cell treatment trials of spinal cord injuries in animals,"Farid MF, S Abouelela Y, Rizk H.","AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to systematically evaluate the efficacy of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (BMSCs-Exo) in improving spinal cord injury (SCI) to mitigate the risk of translational discrepancies from animal experiments to clinical applications. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature search up to March 2024 using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the studies. Data analysis was performed using STATA16 software. RESULTS: A total of 30 studies were included. The results indicated that BMSCs-Exo significantly improved the BBB score in SCI rats (WMD = 3.47, 95% CI [3.31, 3.63]), inhibited the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α (SMD = -3.12, 95% CI [-3.57, -2.67]), and promoted the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 (SMD = 2.76, 95% CI [1.88, 3.63]) and TGF-β (SMD = 3.89, 95% CI [3.02, 4.76]). Additionally, BMSCs-Exo significantly reduced apoptosis levels (SMD = -4.52, 95% CI [-5.14, -3.89]), promoted the expression of axonal regeneration markers NeuN cells/field (SMD = 3.54, 95% CI [2.65, 4.42]), NF200 (SMD = 4.88, 95% CI [3.70, 6.05]), and the number of Nissl bodies (SMD = 1.89, 95% CI [1.13, 2.65]), and decreased the expression of astrogliosis marker GFAP (SMD = -5.15, 95% CI [-6.47, -3.82]). The heterogeneity among studies was primarily due to variations in BMSCs-Exo transplantation doses, with efficacy increasing with higher doses. CONCLUSION: BMSCs-Exo significantly improved motor function in SCI rats by modulating inflammatory responses, reducing apoptosis, inhibiting astrogliosis, and promoting axonal regeneration. However, the presence of selection, performance, and detection biases in current animal experiments may undermine the quality of evidence in this study."

Expectations to allow the hopeless central nervous system to repair itself after injury are unfeasible. Developing new approaches to regenerate the central nervous system is still the priority. Exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-Exo) have been proven to robustly quench the inflammatory response or oxidative stress and curb neuronal apoptosis and autophagy following SCI, which are the key processes to rescue damaged spinal cord neurons and restore their functions. Nonetheless, MSC-Exo in SCI received scant attention. In this review, we reviewed our previous work and other studies to summarize the roles of MSC-Exo in SCI and its underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, we also focus on the application of exosomes as drug carrier in SCI. In particular, it combs the advantages of exosomes as a drug carrier for SCI, imaging advantages, drug types, loading methods, etc., which provides the latest progress for exosomes in the treatment of SCI, especially drug carrier."
Stem cell based strategies for spinal cord injury repair,"Reeves A, Keirstead HS.","AB  - Cytology and histology obstacles have been the main barriers to multiple tissues injury repair. In search of the most promising treatment strategies for spinal cord injury (SCI), stem cell-based transplantation coupled with various materials/technologies have been explored extensively to enhance SCI repair. Chitosan (CS) has demonstrated immense potential for widespread application in the form of scaffolds and micro-particles for SCI repair. The current review summarizes the evidences for stem cell-based transplantation and CS in SCI repair. Stem cells transplantation, which plays a key role in the repair of SCI, mainly results from its neural differentiation potential and neurotrophic effects. Application of CS enhances the survival of grafted stem cells, upregulates the expression level of neurotrophic factors and heightens the neural differentiation of stem cells as well as the functional recovery of spinal cord. Meanwhile, CS can also be exploited as growth factors/RNA carriers to control the release of regenerating molecules which are beneficial to damage spinal cord repair."
Advances in stem cell therapy for spinal cord injury,"Mothe AJ, Tator CH.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) damages both gray matter and white matter, but white matter damage is responsible for the vast majority of the subsequent functional loss. Neural stem cells (NSCs) have been investigated as a means of improving outcomes after SCI, either through neuroprotective properties that limit secondary damage or by direct cell replacement. This review will focus on cell replacement strategies, and the ability of multipotent NSCs to form new functional synaptic relays across sites of even severe SCI. The ability of these early stage neurons to extend axons from the lesion site in large numbers and over long distances constitutes an important mechanism underlying their potential to promote neural repair."
"Adipose-derived stem cell therapy for spinal cord injuries: Advances, challenges, and future directions","Shimizu Y, Ntege EH, Takahara E, Matsuura N, Matsuura R, Kamizato K, Inoue Y, Sowa Y, Sunami H.","AB  - Stem cells (SCs) represent a new therapeutic approach for spinal cord injury (SCI) by enabling improved sensory and motor functions in animal models. The main goal of SC-based therapy for SCI is the replacement of neurons and glial cells that undergo cell death soon after injury. Stem cells are able to promote remyelination via oligodendroglia cell replacement to produce trophic factors enhancing neurite outgrowth, axonal elongation, and fiber density and to activate resident or transplanted progenitor cells across the lesion cavity. While several SC transplantation strategies have shown promising yet partial efficacy, mechanistic proof is generally lacking and is arguably the largest impediment toward faster progress and clinical application. The main challenge ahead is to spur on cooperation between clinicians, researchers, and patients in order to define and optimize the mechanisms of SC function and to establish the ideal source/s of SCs that produce efficient and also safe therapeutic approaches."

Regenerative Therapies for Spinal Cord Injury,"Ashammakhi N, Kim HJ, Ehsanipour A, Bierman RD, Kaarela O, Xue C, Khademhosseini A, Seidlits SK.","AB  - The greatest challenge to successful treatment of spinal cord injury is the limited regenerative capacity of the central nervous system and its inability to replace lost neurons and severed axons following injury. Neural stem cell grafts derived from fetal central nervous system tissue or embryonic stem cells have shown therapeutic promise by differentiation into neurons and glia that have the potential to form functional neuronal relays across injured spinal cord segments. However, implementation of fetal-derived or embryonic stem cell-derived neural stem cell therapies for patients with spinal cord injury raises ethical concerns. Induced pluripotent stem cells can be generated from adult somatic cells and differentiated into neural stem cells suitable for therapeutic use, thereby providing an ethical source of implantable cells that can be made in an autologous fashion to avoid problems of immune rejection.

Currently, there are no remarkable effective therapies for the treatment of SCI. Compared to traditional treatment methods, stem cell transplantation therapy holds potential for repair and functional plasticity after SCI. However, the mechanism of stem cell therapy for SCI remains largely unknown and obscure partly due to the lack of efficient stem cell trafficking methods. Molecular imaging technology including positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), optical imaging (i.e., bioluminescence imaging (BLI)) gives the hope to complete the knowledge concerning basic stem cell biology survival, migration, differentiation, and integration in real time when transplanted into damaged spinal cord.

The development of such scar tissue provides a severe impediment to neural regeneration and healing with restoration of function. A multimodal approach to treatment is required because SCIs occur with differing levels of severity and over different lengths of time. To achieve significant breakthroughs in outcomes, such approaches must combine both neuroprotective and neuroregenerative treatments.

Progression of mesenchymal stem cell regulation on imbalanced microenvironment after spinal cord injury,"Liu Y, Zhao C, Zhang R, Pang Y, Li L, Feng S.","AB  - BACKGROUND: Bladder dysfunction induced by spinal cord injury (SCI) can become problematic and severely impair the quality of life. Preclinical studies of spinal cord injury have largely focused on the recovery of limb function while neglecting to investigate bladder recovery. OBJECTIVE: The present study was performed to investigate and review the effect of stem cell-based cell therapy on bladder recovery in SCI. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of urodynamic findings of experimental trials that included studies of stem cell-based cell therapy in SCI. Relevant studies were searched using MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library (January 1990 - December 2012). Final inclusion was determined by a urodynamic study involving detailed numerical values. Urodynamic parameters for analysis included voiding pressure, residual urine, bladder capacity and non-voiding contraction (NVC). Meta-analysis of the data, including findings from urodynamic studies, was performed using the Mantel-Haenszel method. RESULTS: A total of eight studies were included with a sample size of 224 subjects. The studies were divided into different subgroups by different models of SCI. After a stem cell-based cell therapy, voiding pressure (-6.35, p <0.00001, I2 = 77%), NVC (-3.58, p <0.00001, I2 = 82%), residual urine (-024, p = 0.004, I2 = 95%) showed overall significant improvement. Bladder capacity showed improvement after treatment only in the transection type (-0.23, p = 0.0002, I2 = 0%). CONCLUSION: After stem cell-based cell therapy in SCI, partial bladder recovery including improvement of voiding pressure, NVC, and residual urine was demonstrated. Additional studies are needed to confirm the detailed mechanism and to obtain an ideal treatment strategy for bladder recovery."

The Role of Exosomes and Exosomal Noncoding RNAs From Different Cell Sources in Spinal Cord Injury,"Yang ZL, Rao J, Lin FB, Liang ZY, Xu XJ, Lin YK, Chen XY, Wang CH, Chen CM.","AB  - Stem cell therapy is a potential treatment for spinal cord injury (SCI), and a variety of different stem cell types have been evaluated in animal models and humans with SCI. No consensus exists regarding the type of stem cell, if any, that will prove to be effective therapeutically. Most data suggest that no single therapy will be sufficient to overcome all the biological complications caused by SCI. Rationales for therapeutic use of stem cells for SCI include replacement of damaged neurons and glial cells, secretion of trophic factors, regulation of gliosis and scar formation, prevention of cyst formation, and enhancement of axon elongation. Most therapeutic approaches that use stem cells involve implantation of these cells into the spinal cord. The attendant risks of stem cell therapy for SCI--including tumor formation, or abnormal circuit formation leading to dysfunction--must be weighed against the potential benefits of this approach. This Review will examine the biological effects of SCI, the opportunities for stem cell treatment, and the types of stem cells that might be used therapeutically. The limited information available on the possible benefits of stem cell therapy to humans will also be discussed."
Stem cell-based therapies for spinal cord injury,"Nandoe Tewarie RS, Hurtado A, Bartels RH, Grotenhuis A, Oudega M.","AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammation can worsen spinal cord injury (SCI), with dendritic cells (DCs) playing a crucial role in the inflammatory response. They mediate T lymphocyte differentiation, activate microglia, and release cytokines like NT-3. Moreover, DCs can promote neural stem cell survival and guide them toward neuron differentiation, positively impacting SCI outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to summarize the role of DCs in SCI-related inflammation and identify potential therapeutic targets for treating SCI. METHODS: Literature in PubMed and Web of Science was reviewed using critical terms related to DCs and SCI. RESULTS: The study indicates that DCs can activate microglia and astrocytes, promote T-cell differentiation, increase neurotrophin release at the injury site, and subsequently reduce secondary brain injury and enhance functional recovery in the spinal cord. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights the repair mechanisms of DCs and their potential therapeutic potential for SCI."
Current status and prospective application of stem cell-based therapies for spinal cord injury,"Das AK, Gopurappilly R, Parhar I.","AB  - Transplantation of Schwann cells (SCs) is a promising therapeutic strategy for spinal cord repair. The introduction of SCs into the injured spinal cord has been shown to reduce tissue loss, promote axonal regeneration, and facilitate myelination of axons for improved sensorimotor function. The pathology of spinal cord injury (SCI) comprises multiple processes characterized by extensive cell death, development of a milieu inhibitory to growth, and glial scar formation, which together limits axonal regeneration. Many studies have suggested that significant functional recovery following SCI will not be possible with a single therapeutic strategy. The use of additional approaches with SC transplantation may be needed for successful axonal regeneration and sufficient functional recovery after SCI. An example of such a combination strategy with SC transplantation has been the complementary administration of neuroprotective agents/growth factors, which improves the effect of SCs after SCI. Suspension of SCs in bioactive matrices can also enhance transplanted SC survival and increase their capacity for supporting axonal regeneration in the injured spinal cord. Inhibition of glial scar formation produces a more permissive interface between the SC transplant and host spinal cord for axonal growth. Co-transplantation of SCs and other types of cells such as olfactory ensheathing cells, bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells, and neural stem cells can be a more effective therapy than transplantation of SCs alone following SCI. This article reviews some of the evidence supporting the combination of SC transplantation with additional strategies for SCI repair and presents a prospectus for achieving better outcomes for persons with SCI."
Current progress of rehabilitative strategies in stem cell therapy for spinal cord injury: a review,"Tashiro S, Tsuji O, Shinozaki M, Shibata T, Yoshida T, Tomioka Y, Unai K, Kondo T, Itakura G, Kobayashi Y, Yasuda A, Nori S, Fujiyoshi K, Nagoshi N, Kawakami M, Uemura O, Yamada S, Tsuji T, Okano H, Nakamura M.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI), a prevalent and disabling neurological condition, prompts a growing interest in stem cell therapy as a promising avenue for treatment. Dental-derived stem cells, including dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED), stem cells from the apical papilla (SCAP), dental follicle stem cells (DFSCs), are of interest due to their accessibility, minimally invasive extraction, and robust differentiating capabilities. Research indicates their potential to differentiate into neural cells and promote SCI repair in animal models at both tissue and functional levels. This review explores the potential applications of dental-derived stem cells in SCI neural repair, covering stem cell transplantation, conditioned culture medium injection, bioengineered delivery systems, exosomes, extracellular vesicle treatments, and combined therapies. Assessing the clinical effectiveness of dental-derived stem cells in the treatment of SCI, further research is necessary. This includes investigating potential biological mechanisms and conducting Large-animal studies and clinical trials. It is also important to undertake more comprehensive comparisons, optimize the selection of dental-derived stem cell types, and implement a functionalized delivery system. These efforts will enhance the therapeutic potential of dental-derived stem cells for repairing SCI."
Stem Cells Therapy for Spinal Cord Injury,"Gazdic M, Volarevic V, Harrell CR, Fellabaum C, Jovicic N, Arsenijevic N, Stojkovic M.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating neurological disorder that has a substantial detrimental impact on a person's quality of life. The estimated global incidence of SCI is 40 to 80 cases per million people and around 90% of cases are traumatic. Various etiologies can be recognized for SCI, and post-traumatic SCI represents the most common of these. Patients worldwide with SCI suffer from a persistent loss of motor and sensory function, which affects every aspect of their personal and social lives. Given the lack of effective treatments, many efforts have been made to seek a cure for this condition. In recent years, thanks to their ability to regenerate tissue and repair lost or damaged cells, much attention has been directed toward the use of stem cells (embryonic, induced pluripotent, mesenchymal, hematopoietic), aimed at restoring the functional integrity of the damaged spinal cord and improving a functional recovery including sensory and motor function. In this paper, we offer an overview of the benefits and drawbacks of stem cell therapy for SCI based on clinical evidence. This report also addresses the characteristics of various stem cell treatments, as well as the field's likely future. Each cell type targets specific pathological characteristics associated with SCI and demonstrates therapeutic effects via cell replacement, nutritional support, scaffolds, and immunomodulation pathways. SCI accompanied by complex pathological processes cannot be resolved by single treatment measures. Stem cells are associated with the adjustment of the expression of neurotrophic factors that help to achieve better nutrition to damaged tissue. Single-cell treatments have been shown in some studies to provide very minor benefits for SCI in multiple preclinical studies and a growing number of clinical trials. However, SCI damage is complex, and many studies are increasingly recognizing a combination approach such as physical therapy, electrical stimulation, or medication therapy to treatment."
Urodynamic Parameters in Spinal Cord Injury-Induced Neurogenic Bladder Rats after Stem Cell Transplantation: A Narrative Review,"Abolhasanpour N, Hajebrahimi S, Ebrahimi-Kalan A, Mehdipour A, Salehi-Pourmehr H.","AB  - The efficacy of growth factor gene-modified stem cells in treating spinal cord injury (SCI) remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of growth factor gene-modified stem cells in restoring motor function after SCI. Two reviewers searched four databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus, to identify relevant records. Studies on rodents assessing the efficacy of transplanting growth factor gene-modified stem cells in restoring motor function after SCI were included. The results were reported using the standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Analyses showed that growth factor gene-modified stem cell transplantation improved motor function recovery in rodents with SCI compared to the untreated (SMD = 3.98, 95% CI 3.26-4.70, I(2) = 86.8%, P < 0.0001) and stem cell (SMD = 2.53, 95% CI 1.93-3.13, I(2) = 86.9%, P < 0.0001) groups. Using growth factor gene-modified neural stem/histone cells enhanced treatment efficacy. In addition, the effectiveness increased when viral vectors were employed for gene modification and high transplantation doses were administered during the subacute phase. Stem cells derived from the human umbilical cord exhibited an advantage in motor function recovery. However, the transplantation of growth factor gene-modified stem cells did not significantly improve motor function in male rodents (P = 0.136). Transplantation of growth factor gene-modified stem cells improved motor function in rodents after SCI, but claims of enhanced efficacy should be approached with caution. The safety of gene modification remains a significant concern, requiring additional efforts to enhance its clinical translatability."
Therapeutic Potential of Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes in Spinal Cord Injury,"An J, Chen B, Zhang R, Tian D, Shi K, Zhang L, Zhang G, Wang J, Yang H.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is an enormous public health concern affecting approximately 250,000-500,000 people worldwide each year. It is mostly irreversible considering the limitations of currently available treatments, and its prevention and management have been the prime focus of many studies. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation is one of the most promising treatments for SCI. The role of MSCs in SCI has been studied extensively, and MSCs have been shown to have many limitations. Moreover, the therapeutic effects of MSCs are more likely related to paracrine effects. In SCIs, macrophages from peripheral sources differentiate into M1 macrophages, promoting inflammation and aggravating neuronal damage; however, studies have shown that MSC-derived exosomes can induce the polarization of macrophages from the M1 to the M2 phenotype, thereby promoting nerve function recovery in patients with SCI. In this review, we discussed the research progress of MSC-derived exosomal miRNAs in promoting M2 macrophage differentiation in the SCI, and introduced some exosomal miRNAs that can regulate the differentiation of M2 macrophages in non-SCI; it is hoped that the regulatory role of these exosome-derived miRNAs can be confirmed in SCI."
Spinal cord regeneration using dental stem cell-based therapies,"Xu Y, Chen M, Zhang T, Ma Y, Chen X, Zhou P, Zhao X, Pang F, Liang W.","AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a serious neurological spinal cord damage that resulted in the loss of temporary or permanent function. However, there are even now no effective therapies for it. So, a new medical promising therapeutic hotspot over the previous decades appeared which was (Stem cell (SC) cure of SCI). Otherwise, animal models are considered in preclinical research as a model for humans to trial a potential new treatment. METHODOLOGY: Following articles were saved from different databases (PubMed, Google scholar, Egyptian knowledge bank, Elsevier, Medline, Embase, ProQuest, BMC) on the last two decades, and data were obtained then analyzed. RESULTS: This review discusses the type and grading of SCI. As well as different types of stem cells therapy for SCI, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), neural stem cells (NSCs), hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The review focuses on the transplantation pathways, clinical evaluation, and clinical signs of different types of SC on different animal models which are summarized in tables to give an easy to reach. CONCLUSION: Pharmacological and physiotherapy have limited regenerative power in comparison with stem cells medication in the treatment of SCI. Among several sources of cell therapies, mesenchymal stromal/stem cell (MSC) one is being progressively developed as a trusted important energetic way to repair and regenerate. Finally, a wide-ranged animal models have been condensed that helped in human clinical trial therapies."
Incorporating Combinatorial Approaches to Encourage Targeted Neural Stem/Progenitor Cell Integration Following Transplantation in Spinal Cord Injury,"Pieczonka K, Fehlings MG.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) severely diminishes quality of life and presents patients with a substantial financial burden. The lack of a curative treatment has guided efforts toward identifying potential regenerative treatments. Neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPC) transplantation represents a promising strategy for the regeneration of the injured spinal cord due to the ability of these cells to replace neural cells lost post-injury. However, the transplant-derived oligodendrocytes and neurons need to be able to associate and integrate within the appropriate endogenous circuits to guarantee optimal functional recovery. To date, the integration of these transplant-derived cells has lacked specificity and remains a challenge. As such, it appears that the transplanted cells will require additional guidance cues to instruct the cells where to integrate. In the present review, we propose a variety of combinatorial techniques that can be used in conjunction with NSPC transplantation to direct the cells toward particular circuits of interest. We begin by introducing distinct molecular signatures that assist in the formation of specific circuits during development, and highlight how favorable molecular cues can be incorporated within the cells and their environment to guide the grafted cells. We also introduce alternative methods including task-specific rehabilitation, galvanotaxis, and magnet-based tools, which can be applied to direct the integration of the grafted cells toward the stimulated circuits. Future research examining these combinatorial efforts may serve to improve outcomes following SCI."
An update on application of nanotechnology and stem cells in spinal cord injury regeneration,"Nejati-Koshki K, Mortazavi Y, Pilehvar-Soltanahmadi Y, Sheoran S, Zarghami N.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in loss of nervous tissue and consequently loss of motor and sensory function. There is no treatment available that restores the injury-induced loss of function to a degree that an independent life can be guaranteed. Transplantation of stem cells or progenitors may support spinal cord repair. Stem cells are characterized by self-renewal and their ability to become any cell in an organism. Promising results have been obtained in experimental models of SCI. Stem cells can be directed to differentiate into neurons or glia in vitro, which can be used for replacement of neural cells lost after SCI. Neuroprotective and axon regeneration-promoting effects have also been credited to transplanted stem cells. There are still issues related to stem cell transplantation that need to be resolved, including ethical concerns. This paper reviews the current status of stem cell application for spinal cord repair."
Current status and prospects of regenerative medicine for spinal cord injury using human induced pluripotent stem cells: a review,"Inoue M, Yamaguchi R, He CCJ, Ikeda A, Okano H, Kohyama J.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is damage to the spinal cord due to trauma or health conditions, resulting in lesions in the spinal cord. Currently, available treatment includes surgical intervention to decompress or stabilize a dislocated loose spine, steroid drugs to reduce inflammation, and subsequent rehabilitation. As there is a rising number of SCI globally, radical treatments to recover spinal cord functions have become highly anticipated. The development of new treatments is indeed progressing. Various therapeutic drug candidates are being developed in clinical trials, including neuroprotective/neurotrophic factors, antibodies for repulsive guidance molecules, and cell transplantation. Among them, with advances in stem cell biology, cell transplantation therapy is currently a promising therapeutic development for SCI. In particular, there have been various reports regarding the realization of regenerative medicine using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). This review will introduce the advantages of cell-based therapy based on iPSC-derived neural stem/progenitor cells (iPSC-NS/PCs) and some of their mechanisms of action for functional improvement, which have recently been elucidated. Potential challenges and methodologies to realize the clinical application of iPSC-NS/PCs not only for the subacute phase but also for the chronic phase of SCI will be presented. Finally, we also introduce recent research with a view to the clinical application of spinal cord regenerative therapy and discuss future prospects."
Spinal Cord Injury: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis of Therapeutic Strategies Based on 15 Types of Stem Cells in Animal Models,"Shang Z, Wang R, Li D, Chen J, Zhang B, Wang M, Wang X, Wanyan P.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI), a serious public health issue, most likely occurs in previously healthy young adults. Current therapeutic strategies for SCI includes surgical decompression and pharmacotherapy, however, there is still no gold standard for the treatment of this devastating condition. Inefficiency and adverse effects of standard therapy indicate that novel therapeutic strategies are required. Because of their neuroregenerative and neuroprotective properties, stem cells are a promising tool for the treatment of SCI. Herein, we summarize and discuss the promising therapeutic potential of human embryonic stem cells (hESC), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and ependymal stem/progenitor cells (epSPC) for SCI."
Therapeutic Antibodies for Spinal Cord Injury,"Tang DY, Zhao WJ.","AB  - Neurogenic bladder (NGB) secondary to spinal cord injury (SCI) is accompanied with several complications such as urinary tract deterioration, urinary incontinence, and consequently lower quality of life (QoL), significant morbidities, and occasionally death. Current therapeutic methods have some side effects and there is no treatment for the upper urinary tract injuries. Stem cell therapy is a promising method for treating this condition. However, the best timing and the best route of its transplantation have not yet been determined. Animal models of SCI, especially in rats, are the most commonly used method for evaluating the efficacy of cell therapy in NGB improvement, and the most common assessment method is the urodynamic studies (UDS). However, there are variations in the range of UDS parameters among the published studies. The current review aimed to discuss the effect of stem cell transplantation on bladder dysfunction recovery based on urodynamic parameters after SCI in rats. For this purpose, the cell source, doses, the route of administration, and the complete UDS equipment and its parameters were summarized in SCI models in rats. In some urodynamic test results, to some extent, an improvement in the lower urinary system function was observed in each treatment group. However, this improvement was far from full functional recovery. The average cell dose was about 1 million cells in every injected site. In most studies, the stem cells (SCs) were transplanted 9 days after the injury using PE-50 and PE-60. Many researchers have recommended further experimental and clinical studies to confirm this treatment modality."
Treatment of spinal cord injury with mesenchymal stem cells,"Liau LL, Looi QH, Chia WC, Subramaniam T, Ng MH, Law JX.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a serious problem that primarily affects younger and middle-aged adults at its onset. To date, no effective regenerative treatment has been developed. Over the last decade, researchers have made significant advances in stem cell technology, biomaterials, nanotechnology, and immune engineering, which may be applied as regenerative therapies for the spinal cord. Although the results of clinical trials using specific cell-based therapies have proven safe, their efficacy has not yet been demonstrated. The pathophysiology of SCI is multifaceted, complex and yet to be fully understood. Thus, combinatorial therapies that simultaneously leverage multiple approaches will likely be required to achieve satisfactory outcomes. Although combinations of biomaterials with pharmacologic agents or cells have been explored, few studies have combined these modalities in a systematic way. For most strategies, clinical translation will be facilitated by the use of minimally invasive therapies, which are the focus of this review. In addition, this review discusses previously explored therapies designed to promote neuroregeneration and neuroprotection after SCI, while highlighting present challenges and future directions. Impact Statement To date there are no effective treatments that can regenerate the spinal cord after injury. Although there have been significant preclinical advances in bioengineering and regenerative medicine over the last decade, these have not translated into effective clinical therapies for spinal cord injury. This review focuses on minimally invasive therapies, providing extensive background as well as updates on recent technological developments and current clinical trials. This review is a comprehensive resource for researchers working towards regenerative therapies for spinal cord injury that will help guide future innovation."
Mechanisms of Stem Cell Therapy in Spinal Cord Injuries,"Shinozaki M, Nagoshi N, Nakamura M, Okano H.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is traumatic central nervous system damage resulting in a motor and sensory dysfunction that usually causes a severe and permanent paralysis. Today, the treatment of SCI principally includes surgical treatment, pharmacological treatments and rehabilitation therapies, which target secondary events determining only some clinical improvements in patients. SCI is still a worldwide problem in the clinic and remains a big challenge for neuroscientists and neurologists throughout the world. Therefore, new therapies able to restore the function of the injured spinal cord are urgently needed for SCI patients. An interesting approach to overcome the growth inhibiting properties present in the injured spinal cord is to transplant cells with reparative and protective properties such as mesenchymal stem cells. In this context, human dental-derived stem cells represent a promising new cell source for cell-based therapies. It has been shown that dental-derived stem cells isolated from dental pulp, named dental pulp stem cells or stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth induce functional improvement after SCI in animal models. This review summarises the current state of the literature regarding the use of dental-derived stem cells for spinal cord repair and regeneration and highlights the neuroprotective effects of these cells when administered after spinal cord injury."

However, the specific therapeutic effect and optimal transplantation strategy are still unclear. Therefore, exploring the optimal treatment strategy of UCMSCs in animal studies by systematic review can provide reference for the development of animal studies and clinical research in the future. METHODS: Databases of PubMed, Ovid-Embase, Web of Science, CNKI, WanFang, VIP, and CBM were searched for the literature in February 11, 2022. Two independent reviewers performed the literature search, identification, screening, quality assessment, and data extraction. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A total of 40 animal studies were included for combined analysis. In different subgroups, the results of traditional meta-analysis and network meta-analysis were consistent, that is, the therapeutic effect of high-dose (≥ 1 × 10(6)) transplantation of UCMSCs was significantly better than that of low dose (< 1 × 10(6)), the therapeutic effect of local transplantation of UCMSCs was significantly better than that of intravenous transplantation, and the therapeutic effect of subacute transplantation of UCMSCs was significantly better than that of acute and chronic transplantation. However, in view of the inherent risk of bias and limited internal and external validity of the current animal studies, more high-quality, direct comparison studies are needed to further explore the optimal transplantation strategy for UCMSCs in the future."
Recent advances in the combination of cellular therapy with stem cells and nanoparticles after a spinal cord injury,"García E, Sánchez-Noriega S, González-Pacheco G, González-Vázquez AN, Ibarra A, Rodríguez-Barrera R.","AB  - Stem cell-based regenerative therapy has opened an avenue for functional recovery of patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). Regenerative rehabilitation is attracting wide attention owing to its synergistic effects, feasibility, non-invasiveness, and diverse and systemic properties. In this review article, we summarize the features of rehabilitation, describe the mechanism of combinatorial treatment, and discuss regenerative rehabilitation in the context of SCI. Although conventional rehabilitative methods have commonly been implemented alone, especially in studies of acute-to-subacute SCI, the combinatorial effects of intensive and advanced methods, including various neurorehabilitative approaches, have also been reported. Separating the concept of combined rehabilitation from regenerative rehabilitation, we suggest that the main roles of regenerative rehabilitation can be categorized as conditioning/reconditioning, functional training, and physical exercise, all of which are indispensable for enhancing functional recovery achieved using stem cell therapies."

However, the ethical issues involved in destroying human embryos or fertilized oocytes to obtain stem cells have been a major obstacle to developing clinically useful stem cell sources, and the transplantation of stem cells isolated from other human embryonic tissues has not yet been developed for use in clinical applications. Recently, induced pluripotent stem cells, which can serve as a source of cells for autologous transplantation, have been attracting a great deal of attention as a clinically viable alternative to stem cells obtained directly from tissues. In this review, we outline the neural induction of mouse embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, their therapeutic efficacy in spinal cord injury, and their safety in vivo."
"Pathophysiology, mechanisms and applications of mesenchymal stem cells for the treatment of spinal cord injury","Shende P, Subedi M.","AB  - Spinal cord injuries (SCIs) are a common form of trauma that leaves a huge trail of morbidity and human suffering in its wake. They occur mostly among the young, causing severe physical, psychological, social and economic burdens. The treatment of this condition has rather been disappointing; most of the management strategies being mainly supportive and prophylactic. In recent years there has been an emerging interest in the use of stem cells to regenerate the nervous tissue that has been damaged or lost. Although there has been much hype and unfounded hope, modest successes have been witnessed, and it is possible that these therapeutic strategies may have much more to offer in the future. This paper will review the current strategies of exploring cell-based therapies, mainly different types of stem cells to treat SCI along with the evidence that has been accumulated over the past decade in a rational bench-to-bedside approach. Furthermore, critical aspects such as the mode of delivery and ethical considerations are also discussed along with feasible suggestions for future translational research to provide a contextual picture of the current state of advancements in this field. The impediments to regeneration in the site of injury are briefly explained along with the benefits and drawbacks of different cell types used in the treatment of this condition. We hope that this review will offer a significant insight into this challenging clinical condition."
Treatment of spinal cord injury: a review of engineering using neural and mesenchymal stem cells,"Mortazavi MM, Harmon OA, Adeeb N, Deep A, Tubbs RS.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is damage to the spinal cord that leads to sudden loss of motor and autonomic function and sensory under the level of the injury. The pathophysiological advancement of SCI is divided into two categories: primary injury and secondary injury. Due to the loss of motor, sensory, or cognitive function, a patient's quality of life is likely reduced and places a great burden on society in order to supply health care costs. Therefore, it is important to develop suitable therapeutic strategies for SCI therapy. Nano biomedical systems and stem cell based therapy have the potential to provide new therapeutic availability and efficacy over conventional medicine. Due to their unique properties, nanomaterials and mesenchymal stem cells can be used to offer efficient treatments. Nanoparticles have a potential to deliver therapeutic molecules to the target tissue of interest, reducing side effects of untargeted therapies in unwanted areas. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can reduce activating inflammation responses that lead to cell death and promote functional recovery and cell growth. We review recent uses of nanomaterials and stem cells in regeneration of SCI."
Spinal Cord Injury: How Could Acupuncture Help?,"Fan Q, Cavus O, Xiong L, Xia Y.","AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, combined therapies could help to reduce long-term sequelae of spinal cord injury (SCI); stem cell therapy at the site of injury in combination with other therapies has shown very promising results that can be transferred to the clinical field. Nanoparticles (NPs) are versatile technologies with applications to medical research for treatments of SCI since they could deliver therapeutic molecules to the target tissue and may help to reduce the side effects of non-targeted therapies. This article's purpose is to analyze and concisely describe the diverse cellular therapies in combination with NPs and their regenerative effect after SCI. METHODS: We reviewed the literature related to combinatory therapy for motor impairment following SCI that has been published by Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO host, and PubMed databases. The research covers the databases from 2001 to December 2022. RESULT: Animal models of SCI have shown that the combination of NPs plus stem cells has a positive impact on neuroprotection and neuroregeneration. Further research is required to better understand the effects and benefits of SCI on a clinical level; therefore, it is necessary to find and select the most effective molecules that are capable of exacerbating the neurorestorative effects of the different stem cells and then try them out on patients after SCI. On the other hand, we consider that synthetic polymers such as poly [lactic-co-glycolic acid] (PLGA) could be a candidate for the design of the first therapeutic strategy that combines NPs with stem cells in patients with SCI. The reasons for the selection are that PLGA has shown important advantages over other NPs, such as being biodegradable, having low toxicity levels, and high biocompatibility; In addition, researchers could control the release time and the biodegradation kinetics, and most importantly, it could be used as NMs on other clinical pathologies (12 studies on www.clinicaltrials.gov) and has been approved by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDA). CONCLUSION: The use of cellular therapy and NPs may be a worthwhile alternative for SCI therapy; however, it is expected that the data obtained from interventions after SCI reflect an important variability of molecules combined with NPs. Therefore, it is necessary to properly define the limits of this research to be able to continue to work on the same line. Consequently, the selection of a specific therapeutic molecule and type of NPs plus stem cells are crucial to evaluate its application in clinical trials."
"Spinal Cord Injury: Animal Models, Imaging Tools and the Treatment Strategies","Cizkova D, Murgoci AN, Cubinkova V, Humenik F, Mojzisova Z, Maloveska M, Cizek M, Fournier I, Salzet M.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a traumatic disorder resulting in a functional deficit that usually leads to severe and permanent paralysis. After the initial insult to the spinal cord, additional structure and function are lost through an active and complex secondary process. Since there is not effective treatment for SCI, several strategies including cellular, pharmacological and rehabilitation therapies have been approached in animal models. Some of them have been proved in clinical trials. In this review we focus on the current state of cell therapies, particularly on cells from adult origin, assayed in preclinical research. Cell types used in SCI therapy include Schwann cells, olfactory ensheathing cells and adult stem cells, such as neural stem cells, umbilical cord blood derived cells, mesenchymal stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells. There are not yet conclusive evidences on which types of glial or adult stem cells are most effective in SCI treatment. Their ability to incorporate into the damaged spinal cord, to differentiate into neural lineages, to exert neuroprotective effects, to promote regeneration of damaged axons, and to improve functional deficits are still discussed, before translation towards clinical use, as a single therapy or in combination with other strategies."
Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Spinal Cord Injury,"Alishahi M, Anbiyaiee A, Farzaneh M, Khoshnam SE.","AB  - BACKGROUND: Stem-cell derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) have shown promise in preclinical spinal cord injury (SCI) models but lack a comprehensive literature review for clinical translation guidance. METHODS: This meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis systematically search PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. Prespecified inclusion criteria were studies reporting on measurable outcomes relevant to SCI repair. Risk of bias and quality of reporting were assessed. Random-effects meta-analyses and subgroup analyses comparing natural and bio-engineered EVs were performed. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024512122). FINDINGS: The search identified 3935 records, of which 39 studies were included, totaling 1801 animals. Administration of EVs significantly improved locomotor function as measured by Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan or Basso-Mouse-Scale scores at 1 week (natural EVs: SMD 1.50, 95 % CI 1.06-1.95; bio-engineered EVs: SMD 1.93, 95 % CI 1.34-2.52) and 3 weeks (natural EVs: SMD 2.57, 95 % CI 1.96-3.17; bio-engineered EVs: SMD 3.16, 95 % CI 2.29-4.02) post-injury. Subgroup analyses indicated surface modification approaches were most effective among bio-engineered EV strategies. EVs also promoted nerve growth (SMD 2.95, 95 % CI 2.12-3.78), enhanced neuron conductivity (MD 0.75, 95 %CI 0.59-0.90), alleviated inflammation (SMD -3.12, 95 % CI -4.15--2.10), and reduced lesion size (SMD -2.90, 95 % CI -3.87--1.93). CONCLUSIONS: Both natural and bio-engineered EVs improve functional and pathological outcomes in animal models of SCI. The enhanced benefits observed with bio-engineered EVs, particularly those utilizing surface modification approaches, highlight the importance of continued exploration into bio-engineering techniques to optimize EVs' therapeutic efficacy for SCI repair.

Clinical translation of stem cell based interventions for spinal cord injury - Are we there yet?,"Chhabra HS, Sarda K.","AB  - A number of potential approaches aim to optimize functional recovery after spinal cord injury. They include minimizing the progression of secondary injury, manipulating the neuroinhibitory environment of the spinal cord, replacing lost tissue with transplanted cells or peripheral nerve grafts, remyelinating denuded axons, and maximizing the intrinsic regenerative potential of endogenous progenitor cells. We review the application of stem cell transplantation to the spinal cord, emphasizing the use of embryonic stem cells for remyelinating damaged axons. We speculate that harnessing the potential of endogenously born stem cells already present in the spinal cord represents an important therapeutic target. We also discuss the potential application of peripheral nervous system reconstruction to recovery from spinal cord injury. The principles of peripheral nerve regeneration and concepts of nerve grafting are reviewed. Particular attention is given to peripheral nerve allotransplantation for repairing extensively injured tissue when autologous donor nerve material is scarce. The potential role of nerve transfers for reconstructing the injured spinal cord, particularly the cauda equina and lumbosacral plexus, are also described."
Potential of Combination of Bone Marrow Nucleated and Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Complete Spinal Cord Injury,"Katoh S, Dedeepiya VD, Kuroda S, Iwasaki M, Senthilkumar R, Preethy S, Abraham SJK.","AB  - Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) may occur across the lifespan and is of global relevance. Damage of the spinal cord results in para- or tetraplegia and is associated with neuropathic pain, spasticity, respiratory, and autonomic dysfunction (i.e., control of bladder-bowel function). While the acute surgical treatment aims at stabilizing the spine and decompressing the damaged spinal cord, SCI patients require neurorehabilitation to restore neural function and to compensate for any impairments including motor disability, pain treatment, and bladder/bowel management. However, the spinal cord has a limited capacity to regenerate and much of the disability may persist, depending on the initial lesion severity and level of injury. For this reason, and the lack of effective drug treatments, there is an emerging interest and urgent need in promoting axonal regeneration and remyelination after SCI through cell- and stem-cell based therapies. This review briefly summarizes the state-of the art management of acute SCI and its neurorehabilitation to critically appraise phase I/II trials from the last two decades that have investigated cell-based therapies (i.e., Schwann cells, macrophages, and olfactory ensheathing cells) and stem cell-based therapies (i.e., neural stem cells, mesenchymal, and hematopoietic stem cells). Recently, two large multicenter trials provided evidence for the safety and feasibility of neural stem cell transplantation into the injured cord, whilst two monocenter trials also showed this to be the case for the transplantation of Schwann cells into the posttraumatic cord cavity. These are milestone studies that will facilitate further interventional trials. However, the clinical adoption of such approaches remains unproven, as there is only limited encouraging data, often in single patients, and no proven trial evidence to support regulatory approval."
Human Pluripotent Stem Cells for Spinal Cord Injury,"Farzaneh M, Anbiyaiee A, Khoshnam SE.","AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is the damage to the spinal cord that can lead to temporary or permanent loss of function due to injury to the nerve. The SCI patients are often associated with poor quality of life. RESULTS: This review discusses the current status of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy for SCI, criteria to considering for the application of MSC therapy and novel biological therapies that can be applied together with MSCs to enhance its efficacy. Bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs), umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) and adipose tissue-derived MSCs (ADSCs) have been trialed for the treatment of SCI. Application of MSCs may minimize secondary injury to the spinal cord and protect the neural elements that survived the initial mechanical insult by suppressing the inflammation. Additionally, MSCs have been shown to differentiate into neuron-like cells and stimulate neural stem cell proliferation to rebuild the damaged nerve tissue. CONCLUSION: These characteristics are crucial for the restoration of spinal cord function upon SCI as damaged cord has limited regenerative capacity and it is also something that cannot be achieved by pharmacological and physiotherapy interventions. New biological therapies including stem cell secretome therapy, immunotherapy and scaffolds can be combined with MSC therapy to enhance its therapeutic effects."
A Comparative Study of Different Stem Cell Transplantation for Spinal Cord Injury: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis,"Liu S, Zhang H, Wang H, Huang J, Yang Y, Li G, Yu K, Yang L.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) not only affects the quality of life of patients but also poses a heavy burden on their families. Therefore, it is essential to prevent the occurrence of SCI; for unpreventable SCI, it is critical to develop effective treatments. In recent years, various major breakthroughs have been made in cell therapy to protect and regenerate the damaged spinal cord via various mechanisms such as immune regulation, paracrine signaling, extracellular matrix (ECM) modification, and lost cell replacement. Nevertheless, many recent studies have shown that the cell therapy has many disadvantages, such as tumorigenicity, low survival rate, and immune rejection. Because of these disadvantages, the clinical application of cell therapy is limited. In recent years, the role of exosomes in various diseases and their therapeutic potential have attracted much attention. The same is true for exosomal noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), which do not encode proteins but affect transcriptional and translational processes by targeting specific mRNAs. This review focuses on the mechanism of action of exosomes obtained from different cell sources in the treatment of SCI and the regulatory role and therapeutic potential of exosomal ncRNAs. This review also discusses the future opportunities and challenges, proposing that exosomes and exosomal ncRNAs might be promising tools for the treatment of SCI."
Gene-Modified Stem Cells for Spinal Cord Injury: a Promising Better Alternative Therapy,"Feng Y, Li Y, Shen PP, Wang B.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most common causes of death and disability worldwide, and it can result in both permanent disability and serial complications in patients. Research shows that patients with SCI complications are often interested in acupuncture for symptomatic relief. Therefore, the issue of physicians advising their patients regarding the use of acupuncture to alleviate SCI complications becomes pertinent. We review and summarize two types of relevant publications: (1) literature concerning acupuncture for SCI and its complications and (2) underlying mechanisms of acupuncture therapy for SCI. Clinical trials and reviews have suggested that acupuncture effectively manages a range of post-SCI complications, including motor and sensory dysfunction, pain, neurogenic bowel and bladder, pressure ulcers, spasticity, and osteoporosis. The effect of acupuncture on post-SCI orthostatic hypotension and sexual dysfunction remains unclear. Decreased oxidative stress, inhibition of inflammation and neuronal apoptosis, regulation of the expression and activity of endogenous biological mediators, and increased regenerative stem cell production are the possible mechanisms of acupuncture therapy for SCI. Although many limitations have been reported in previous studies, given the evidence for the efficacy of acupuncture, we recommend that physicians should support the use of acupuncture therapy for SCI complications."
Neuronal reprogramming in treating spinal cord injury,"Chen X, Li H.","AB  - Spinal Cord Injury (SCI), as a devastating and life-altering neurological disorder, is one of the most serious health issues. Currently, the management of acute SCI includes pharmacotherapy and surgical decompression. Both the approaches have been observed to have adverse physiological effects on SCI patients. Therefore, novel therapeutic targets for the management of SCI are urgently required for developing cell-based therapies. Multipotent stem cells, as a novel strategy for the treatment of tissue injury, may provide an effective therapeutic option against many neurological disorders. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or multipotent stromal cells can typically self-renew and generate various cell types. These cells are often isolated from bone marrow (BM-MSCs), adipose tissues (AD-MSCs), umbilical cord blood (UCB-MSCs), and placenta (PMSCs). MSCs have remarkable potential for the development of regenerative therapies in animal models and humans with SCI. Herein, we summarize the therapeutic potential of human MSCs in the treatment of SCI."
Cell Transplantation for Spinal Cord Injury: Tumorigenicity of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Neural Stem/Progenitor Cells,"Deng J, Zhang Y, Xie Y, Zhang L, Tang P.","AB  - Every year, 0.93 million people worldwide suffer from spinal cord injury (SCI) with irretrievable sequelae. Rehabilitation, currently the only available treatment, does not restore damaged tissues; therefore, the functional recovery of patients remains limited. The pathophysiology of spinal cord injuries is heterogeneous, implying that potential therapeutic targets differ depending on the time of injury onset, the degree of injury, or the spinal level of injury. In recent years, despite a significant number of clinical trials based on various types of stem cells, these aspects of injury have not been effectively considered, resulting in difficult outcomes of trials. In a specialty such as cancerology, precision medicine based on a patient's characteristics has brought indisputable therapeutic advances. The objective of the present review is to promote the development of precision medicine in the field of SCI. Here, we first describe the multifaceted pathophysiology of SCI, with the temporal changes after injury, the characteristics of the chronic phase, and the subtypes of complete injury. We then detail the appropriate targets and related mechanisms of the different types of stem cell therapy for each pathological condition. Finally, we highlight the great potential of stem cell therapy in cervical SCI."
Pericytes Make Spinal Cord Breathless after Injury,"Almeida VM, Paiva AE, Sena IFG, Mintz A, Magno LAV, Birbrair A.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) as a serious public health issue and neurological insult is one of the most severe cause of long-term disability. To date, a variety of techniques have been widely developed to treat central nervous system injury. Currently, clinical treatments are limited to surgical decompression and pharmacotherapy. Because of their negative effects and inefficiency, novel therapeutic approaches are required in the management of SCI. Improvement and innovation of stem cell-based therapies have a huge potential for biological and future clinical applications. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) including embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are defined by their abilities to divide asymmetrically, self-renew and ultimately differentiate into various cell lineages. There are considerable research efforts to use various types of stem cells, such as ESCs, neural stem cells (NSCs), and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the treatment of patients with SCI. Moreover, the use of patient-specific iPSCs holds great potential as an unlimited cell source for generating in vivo models of SCI. In this review, we focused on the potential of hPSCs in treating SCI."
Could conditioned medium be used instead of stem cell transplantation to repair spinal cord injury in animal models? Identifying knowledge gaps,"Hajisoltani R, Taghizadeh M, Hamblin MR, Ramezani F.","AB  - Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is one of the hopeful treatments for spinal cord injury (SCI). Most current studies are in animals, and less in humans, and the optimal transplantation strategy for MSCs is still controversial. In this article, we explore the optimal transplantation strategy of MSCs through a network meta-analysis of the effects of MSCs on SCI in animal models. PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database, China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), and Chinese Biomedical Literature Service System (SinoMed) databases were searched by computer for randomized controlled studies on MSCs for SCI. Two investigators independently completed the literature screening and data extraction based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. RevMan 5.4 software was used to assess the quality of the included literature. Stata 16.0 software was used for standard meta-analysis and network meta-analysis. Standardized mean difference (SMD) was used for continuous variables to combine the statistics and calculate 95% confidence interval (95% CI). P < 0.05 was considered a statistically significant difference. Cochrane's Q test and the I(2) value were used to indicate the magnitude of heterogeneity. A random-effects model was used if I(2) > 50% and P < 0.10 indicated significant heterogeneity between studies, and conversely, a fixed-effects model was used. Evidence network diagrams were drawn based on direct comparisons between various interventions. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve area (SUCRA) was used to predict the ranking of the treatment effects of each intervention. A total of 32 animal studies were included in this article for analysis. The results of the standard meta-analysis showed that MSCs improved motor ability after SCI. The network meta-analysis showed that the best treatment effect was achieved for adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ADMSCs) in terms of cell source and intrathecal (IT) in terms of transplantation modality. For transplantation timing, the best treatment effect was achieved when transplantation was performed in the subacute phase. The available literature suggests that IT transplantation using ADMSCs in the subacute phase may be the best transplantation strategy to improve functional impairment after SCI. Future high-quality studies are still needed to further validate the results of this study to ensure the reliability of the results."
Current evidence on mesenchymal stem cell therapy for traumatic spinal cord injury: systematic review and meta-analysis,"Muthu S, Jeyaraman M, Gulati A, Arora A.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) often leads to irreversible neuro-degenerative changes with life-long consequences. While there is still no effective therapy available, the results of past research have led to improved quality of life for patients suffering from partial or permanent paralysis. In this review we focus on the need, importance and the scientific value of experimental animal models simulating SCI in humans. Furthermore, we highlight modern imaging tools determining the location and extent of spinal cord damage and their contribution to early diagnosis and selection of appropriate treatment. Finally, we focus on available cellular and acellular therapies and novel combinatory approaches with exosomes and active biomaterials. Here we discuss the efficacy and limitations of adult mesenchymal stem cells which can be derived from bone marrow, adipose tissue or umbilical cord blood and its Wharton's jelly. Special attention is paid to stem cell-derived exosomes and smart biomaterials due to their special properties as a delivery system for proteins, bioactive molecules or even genetic material."
A Review of Treatment Methods Focusing on Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Neural Stem/Progenitor Cell Transplantation for Chronic Spinal Cord Injury,"Shibata T, Tashiro S, Nakamura M, Okano H, Nagoshi N.","AB  - Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) is a serious devastating condition associated to the high chances of morbidity and mortality. It involves a primary and a secondary injury, former cause damages to both lower and upper motor neurones and disrupts sensory, motor and autonomic functions while the latter involves various stages of molecular plus cellular incidents which elaborate the original injury. In the treatment of SCI, stem cells possess a good therapeutic potential. Bone marrow, adipose tissue, placenta, amniotic fluid and umbilical cord are the good sources for mesenchymal stem cells. This review article shows the uses of bone marrow derived mesenchymal cells in the treatment of acute and chronic case of SCI and its future scope."
The roles of neural stem cells in myelin regeneration and repair therapy after spinal cord injury,"Li C, Luo Y, Li S.","AB  - The drawbacks of stem cell (SC) therapies have led to investigations of SC conditioned medium (CM) instead of SC transplantation in the repair of spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the effectiveness of CM in comparison with cell transplantation in SCI models remain an open and intriguing question. The focus of this review was to survey existing publications addressing this comparison. The review included articles from electronic databases Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science that included comparisons of the effects of CM versus SC transplantation and versus controls on locomotion after SCI. The search yielded 5 studies and 6 experiments. The results indicated that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that treatment with CM and source cells were equally effective (SMD = 0.12; 95% CI = -0.36 to 0.59; p = 0.07). Regarding investigations of separate effects of SCs versus CM, there currently is limited evidence on efficacy in SCI models. This highlights a notable concern affecting this field. Thus, we identified critical knowledge gaps concerning comparisons of the efficacy of therapeutic application of SC and their derived CM on functional recovery following SCI."
Concise review: reactive astrocytes and stem cells in spinal cord injury: good guys or bad guys?,"Lukovic D, Stojkovic M, Moreno-Manzano V, Jendelova P, Sykova E, Bhattacharya SS, Erceg S.","AB  - Over time, various treatment modalities for spinal cord injury have been trialed, including pharmacological and nonpharmacological methods. Among these, replacement of the injured neural and paraneural tissues via cellular transplantation of neural and mesenchymal stem cells has been the most attractive. Extensive experimental studies have been done to identify the safety and effectiveness of this transplantation in animal and human models. Herein, we review the literature for studies conducted, with a focus on the human-related studies, recruitment, isolation, and transplantation, of these multipotent stem cells, and associated outcomes."
iPS cell transplantation for traumatic spinal cord injury,"Goulão M, Lepore AC.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is an intractable and worldwide difficult medical challenge with limited treatments. Neural stem/progenitor cell (NS/PC) transplantation derived from fetal tissues or embryonic stem cells (ESCs) has demonstrated therapeutic effects via replacement of lost neurons and severed axons and creation of permissive microenvironment to promote repair of spinal cord and axon regeneration but causes ethnical concerns and immunological rejections as well. Thus, the implementation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which can be generated from adult somatic cells and differentiated into NS/PCs, provides an effective alternation in the treatment of SCI. However, as researches further deepen, there is accumulating evidence that the use of iPSC-derived NS/PCs shows mounting concerns of safety, especially the tumorigenicity. This review discusses the tumorigenicity of iPSC-derived NS/PCs focusing on the two different routes of tumorigenicity (teratomas and true tumors) and underlying mechanisms behind them, as well as possible solutions to circumvent them."
Neural Stem Cells: Promoting Axonal Regeneration and Spinal Cord Connectivity,"de Freria CM, Van Niekerk E, Blesch A, Lu P.","AB  - Traumatic spinal cord injury is a devastating condition that leads to significant neurological deficits and reduced quality of life. Therapeutic interventions after spinal cord lesions are designed to address multiple aspects of the secondary damage. However, the lack of detailed knowledge about the cellular and molecular changes that occur after spinal cord injury restricts the design of effective treatments. Li and colleagues using a rat model of spinal cord injury and in vivo microscopy reveal that pericytes play a key role in the regulation of capillary tone and blood flow in the spinal cord below the site of the lesion. Strikingly, inhibition of specific proteins expressed by pericytes after spinal cord injury diminished hypoxia and improved motor function and locomotion of the injured rats. This work highlights a novel central cellular population that might be pharmacologically targeted in patients with spinal cord trauma. The emerging knowledge from this research may provide new approaches for the treatment of spinal cord injury."
Therapeutic Potential of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) and MSC-Derived Extracellular Vesicles for the Treatment of Spinal Cord Injury,"Kim GU, Sung SE, Kang KK, Choi JH, Lee S, Sung M, Yang SY, Kim SK, Kim YI, Lim JH, Seo MS, Lee GW.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) can result in the permanent loss of mobility, sensation, and autonomic function. Secondary degeneration after SCI both initiates and propagates a hostile microenvironment that is resistant to natural repair mechanisms. Consequently, exogenous stem cells have been investigated as a potential therapy for repairing and recovering damaged cells after SCI and other CNS disorders. This focused review highlights the contributions of mesenchymal (MSCs) and dental stem cells (DSCs) in attenuating various secondary injury sequelae through paracrine and cell-to-cell communication mechanisms following SCI and other types of neurotrauma. These mechanistic events include vascular dysfunction, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, apoptosis and cell loss, neuroinflammation, and structural deficits. The review of studies that directly compare MSC and DSC capabilities also reveals the superior capabilities of DSC in reducing the effects of secondary injury and promoting a favorable microenvironment conducive to repair and regeneration. This review concludes with a discussion of the current limitations and proposes improvements in the future assessment of stem cell therapy through the reporting of the effects of DSC viability and DSC efficacy in attenuating secondary damage after SCI."
Restoration of spinal cord injury: From endogenous repairing process to cellular therapy,"Wu Y, Tang Z, Zhang J, Wang Y, Liu S.","AB  - Cell transplantation therapy using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem/progenitor cells (hiPSC-NS/PCs) has attracted attention as a regenerative therapy for spinal cord injury (SCI), and its efficacy in treating the subacute phase of SCI has been reported in numerous studies. However, few studies have focused on treatment in the chronic phase, which accounts for many patients, suggesting that there are factors that are difficult to overcome in the treatment of chronic SCI. The search for therapeutic strategies that focus on chronic SCI is fraught with challenges, and the combination of different therapies is thought to be the key to a solution. In addition, many issues remain to be addressed, including the investigation of therapeutic approaches for more severe injury models of chronic SCI and the acquisition of practical motor function. This review summarizes the current progress in regenerative therapy for SCI and discusses the prospects for regenerative medicine, particularly in animal models of chronic SCI."
Stem cell-based treatments for spinal cord injury,"Wyatt LA, Keirstead HS.","AB  - BACKGROUND: Cell-based therapies represent one of the definitive treatment approaches to SCI which, to become a routine clinical application, is marred by several known unknowns. The Bone Marrow Mononuclear Cells (BMMNCs) and Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) represent the most clinically applied cell types for SCI in humans, with safety established, and to an extent, efficacy reported. METHODS: In this review, we have analysed the clinical studies performed using BMMNC and MSC for complete SCI separately, and the potential for applying those cells in combination. We have also analysed those factors whose outcome in animal studies of SCI could be evaluated in depth but the clinical outcome cannot be evaluated intrinsically owing to practical difficulties. CONCLUSION: A combination of these two cell types, BMMNC and MSC, has been proven to be advantageous than applying them separately. Therefore, a thorough evaluation including the rationale and potential implications of applying these two therapies has been presented here, and we hypothesize that such a combination is likely to improvise the outcome of a wholesome approach to spinal cord regeneration after SCI."
Stem Cells Therapy for Spinal Cord Injury: An Overview of Clinical Trials,"Silvestro S, Bramanti P, Trubiani O, Mazzon E.","AB  - Recent advances in basic science in research related to spinal cord injury (SCI) and regeneration have led to a variety of novel experimental therapeutics designed to promote functionally effective axonal regrowth and sprouting. Stem cell and other cellular interventions have gained lot of attention due to their immense potential of regeneration. These interventions have been tested for their efficacy in case of SCI both at the pre-clinical and clinical level. In this review we critically discuss the published literature on the cellular interventions for SCI and their clinical applications with respect to the strength of evidence established by these studies. The need to curb unethical practice of offering unproven stem cell therapies"" for SCI at a global level is also discussed."""
Clinical translation of stem cell therapy for spinal cord injury still premature: results from a single-arm meta-analysis based on 62 clinical trials,"Shang Z, Wang M, Zhang B, Wang X, Wanyan P.","AB  - Neuronal injuries, as one of the consequences of sports-related incidents, exert a profound influence on the athletes' future, potentially leading to complete immobility and impeding their athletic pursuits. In cases of severe damage inflicted upon the spinal cord (SC) and peripheral nervous systems (PNS), the regenerative process is notably compromised, rendering it essentially inefficient. Among the pivotal therapeutic approaches for the enhancement and prevention of secondary SC injuries (SCI), stem cell transplantation (SCT) stands out prominently. Stem cells, whether directly involved in replacement and reconstruction or indirectly through modification and secretion of crucial bioenvironmental factors, engage in the intricate process of tissue regeneration. Stem cells, through the secretion of neurotrophic factors (NTFs) (aiming to modulate the immune system), reduction of inflammation, axonal growth stimulation, and myelin formation, endeavor to facilitate the regeneration of damaged SC tissue. The fundamental challenges of this approach encompass the proper selection of suitable stem cell candidates for transplantation and the establishment of an appropriate microenvironment conducive to SC repair. In this article, an attempt has been made to explore sports-related injuries, particularly SCI, to comprehensively review innovative methods for treating SCI, and to address the existing challenges. Additionally, some of the stem cells used in neural injuries and the process of their utilization have been discussed."
Electrospun Fibers for Spinal Cord Injury Research and Regeneration,"Schaub NJ, Johnson CD, Cooper B, Gilbert RJ.","AB  - INTRODUCTION: Exosomes function as cell signaling carriers and have drawn much attention to the cell-free treatments of regenerative medicine. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cell-derived (MSC-derived) exosomes in animal models of spinal cord injuries (SCI). METHOD: A comprehensive search was conducted in Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science to attain related articles published by January 31, 2023. The eligible keywords were correlated with the spinal cord injury and MSC-derived exosomes. The evaluated outcomes were locomotion, cavity size, cell apoptosis, inflammation, neuro-regeneration, and microglia activation. A standardized mean difference was calculated for each sample and a pooled effect size was reported. RESULTS: 65 papers fully met the inclusion criteria. Treatment with MSC-derived exosomes ultimately improved locomotion and shrunk cavity size (p<0.0001). The administration of MSC-derived exosomes enhanced the expression of beta-tubulin III, NF200, and GAP-43, and increased the number of NeuN-positive and Nissl-positive cells, while reducing the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (p<0.0001). The number of apoptotic cells in the treatment group decreased significantly (p<0.0001). Regarding the markers of microglia activation, MSC-derived exosomes increased the number of CD206- and CD68-positive cells (p=0.032 and p<0.0001, respectively). Additionally, MSC-derived exosome administration significantly increased the expression of the anti-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-4 (p<0.001 and p=0.001, respectively) and decreased the expression of the inflammatory IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-a (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: MSC-derived exosome treatment resulted in a significantly improved locomotion of SCI animals through ameliorating neuroinflammation, reducing apoptosis, and inducing neuronal regrowth by facilitating a desirable microenvironment."
The Application of Biomaterials in Spinal Cord Injury,"Feng C, Deng L, Yong YY, Wu JM, Qin DL, Yu L, Zhou XG, Wu AG.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a long-lasting damage in the spinal cord that leads to paraparesis, paraplegia, quadriplegia and other lifetime disabilities. The underlying mechanisms responsible for the failure of axonal regeneration after SCI remain only partially understood. Although a spectrum of medical treatments has been made available for this disease, the therapeutic effects remain disappointing. The emergence of antibody treatment has paved a new pathway for the management of SCI. In this current review, we summarized the application of antibodies in SCI in studies of myelin repair, neuroprotection, axon outgrowth, and anti-immune reaction. In the meantime, the combination treatment of the antibody with other reagents or stem cell transplant was also reviewed."
Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells for Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury,"Khazaei M, Ahuja CS, Fehlings MG.","AB  - Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) is a condition characterized by complete or incomplete motor and sensory impairment, as well as dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, caused by factors such as trauma, tumors, or inflammation. Current treatment methods primarily include traditional approaches like spinal canal decompression and internal fixation surgery, steroid pulse therapy, as well as newer techniques such as stem cell transplantation and brain-spinal cord interfaces. However, the above methods have limited efficacy in promoting axonal and neuronal regeneration. The challenge in medical research today lies in promoting spinal cord neuron regeneration and regulating the disrupted microenvironment of the spinal cord. Studies have shown that gas molecular therapy is increasingly used in medical research, with gasotransmitters such as hydrogen sulfide, nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, oxygen, and hydrogen exhibiting neuroprotective effects in central nervous system diseases. The gas molecular protect against neuronal death and reshape the microenvironment of spinal cord injuries by regulating oxidative, inflammatory and apoptotic processes. At present, gas therapy mainly relies on inhalation for systemic administration, which cannot effectively enrich and release gas in the spinal cord injury area, making it difficult to achieve the expected effects. With the rapid development of nanotechnology, the use of nanocarriers to achieve targeted enrichment and precise control release of gas at Sites of injury has become one of the emerging research directions in SCI. It has shown promising therapeutic effects in preclinical studies and is expected to bring new hope and opportunities for the treatment of SCI. In this review, we will briefly outline the therapeutic effects and research progress of gasotransmitters and nanogas in the treatment of SCI."
Spinal Cord Repair: From Cells and Tissue Engineering to Extracellular Vesicles,"Guo S, Redenski I, Levenberg S.","AB  - Cell replacement strategies hold great promise for the treatment of central nervous system injuries and degenerative diseases. The advancement of stem cell therapies has proven to be a viable therapeutic approach to limit secondary degeneration and restore neuronal circuitry at the site of injury. Cell replacement strategies confer phenotype-specific and neurotrophic benefits to the surrounding tissue; however, the mechanisms of transplant-mediated repair are unique to each transplant population. Here, we review stem cell-based therapies for spinal cord injury and disease, involving a number of stem cell derivates. We discuss the mechanisms by which each of these populations exert their affects and briefly discuss phenotype-specific cell replacement in these models."
"Melatonin, a natural antioxidant therapy in spinal cord injury","Xie L, Wu H, Huang X, Yu T.","AB  - Objective: The optimal therapeutic strategies of stem cells for spinal cord injury (SCI) are fully explored in animal studies to promote the translation of preclinical findings to clinical practice, also to provide guidance for future animal experiments and clinical studies. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, CNKI, Wangfang, VIP, and CBM were searched from inception to September 2021. Screening of search results, data extraction, and references quality evaluation were undertaken independently by two reviewers. Results and Discussion: A total of 188 studies were included for data analysis. Results of traditional meta-analysis showed that all 15 diverse types of stem cells could significantly improve locomotor function of animals with SCI, and results of further network meta-analysis showed that adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells had the greatest therapeutic potential for SCI. Moreover, a higher dose (≥1 × 106) of stem cell transplantation had better therapeutic effect, transplantation in the subacute phase (3-14 days, excluding 3 days) was the optimal timing, and intralesional transplantation was the optimal route. However, the evidence of current animal studies is of limited quality, and more high-quality research is needed to further explore the optimal therapeutic strategies of stem cells, while the design and implementation of experiments, as well as measurement and reporting of results for animal studies, need to be further improved and standardized to reduce the risk when the results of animal studies are translated to the clinic.

Evaluation of the Clinical Efficacy of Stem Cell Transplantation in the Treatment of Spinal Cord Injury: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Tang QR, Xue H, Zhang Q, Guo Y, Xu H, Liu Y, Liu JM.","AB  - The spinal cord and the brain form the central nervous system (CNS), which is the most important part of the body. However, spinal cord injury (SCI) caused by external forces is one of the most difficult types of neurological injury to treat, resulting in reduced or even absent motor, sensory and autonomic functions. It leads to the reduction or even disappearance of motor, sensory and self-organizing nerve functions. Currently, its incidence is increasing each year worldwide. Therefore, the development of treatments for SCI is urgently needed in the clinic. To date, surgery, drug therapy, stem cell transplantation, regenerative medicine, and rehabilitation therapy have been developed for the treatment of SCI. Among them, regenerative biomaterials that use tissue engineering and bioscaffolds to transport cells or drugs to the injured site are considered the most promising option. In this review, we briefly introduce SCI and its molecular mechanism and summarize the application of biomaterials in the repair and regeneration of tissue in various models of SCI. However, there is still limited evidence about the treatment of SCI with biomaterials in the clinic. Finally, this review will provide inspiration and direction for the future study and application of biomaterials in the treatment of SCI."
Epidural electrical stimulation for spinal cord injury,"Choi EH, Gattas S, Brown NJ, Hong JD, Limbo JN, Chan AY, Oh MY.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a traumatic lesion that causes disability with temporary or permanent sensory and/or motor deficits. The pharmacological approach still in use for the treatment of SCI involves the employment of corticosteroid drugs. However, SCI remains a very complex disorder that needs future studies to find effective pharmacological treatments. SCI actives a strong inflammatory response that induces a loss of neurons followed by a cascade of events that lead to further spinal cord damage. Many experimental studies demonstrate the therapeutic effect of stem cells in SCI due to their capacity to differentiate into neuronal cells and by releasing neurotrophic factors. Therefore, they appear to be a valid strategy to use in the field of regenerative medicine. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of clinical trials, recorded in clinical trial.gov during 2005-2019, aimed to evaluate the use of stem cell-based therapy in SCI. The results available thus far show the safety and efficacy of stem cell therapy in patients with SCI. However, future trials are needed to investigate the safety and efficacy of stem cell transplantation."
Stem Cell Secretome for Spinal Cord Repair: Is It More than Just a Random Baseline Set of Factors?,"Pajer K, Bellák T, Nógrádi A.","AB  - Stem cell therapy holds great promise for the treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI), which can reverse neurodegeneration and promote tissue regeneration via its pluripotency and ability to secrete neurotrophic factors. Although various stem cell-based approaches have shown certain therapeutic effects when applied to the treatment of SCI, their clinical efficacies have been disappointing. Thus, it is an urgent need to further enhance the neurological benefits of stem cells through bioengineering strategies including genetic engineering. In this review, we summarize the progress of stem cell therapy for SCI and the prospect of genetically modified stem cells, focusing on the genome editing tools and functional molecules involved in SCI repair, trying to provide a deeper understanding of genetically modified stem cell therapy and more applicable clinical strategies for SCI repair."
Regenerative Medicine for Spinal Cord Injury Using Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells,"Nagoshi N, Sugai K, Okano H, Nakamura M.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a common cause of mortality and neurological morbidity. Although progress had been made in the last decades in medical, surgical, and rehabilitation treatments for SCI, the outcomes of these approaches are not yet ideal. The use of cell transplantation as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of SCI is very promising. Cell therapies for the treatment of SCI are limited by several translational road blocks, including ethical concerns in relation to cell sources. The use of iPSCs is particularly attractive, given that they provide an autologous cell source and avoid the ethical and moral considerations of other stem cell sources. In addition, different cell types, that are applicable to SCI, can be created from iPSCs. Common cell sources used for reprogramming are skin fibroblasts, keratinocytes, melanocytes, CD34+ cells, cord blood cells and adipose stem cells. Different cell types have different genetic and epigenetic considerations that affect their reprogramming efficiencies. Furthermore, in SCI the iPSCs can be differentiated to neural precursor cells, neural crest cells, neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and even mesenchymal stromal cells. These can produce functional recovery by replacing lost cells and/or modulating the lesion microenvironment."
Synergistic effects of curcumin and stem cells on spinal cord injury: a comprehensive review,"Arefnezhad R, Jahandideh A, Rezaei M, Khatouni MS, Zarei H, Jahani S, Molavi A, Hefzosseheh M, Ghasempour P, Movahedi HM, Jahandideh R, Rezaei-Tazangi F.","AB  - Spinal cord injury represents a devastating central nervous system injury that could impair the mobility and sensory function of afflicted patients. The hallmarks of spinal cord injury include neuroinflammation, axonal degeneration, neuronal loss, and reactive gliosis. Furthermore, the formation of a glial scar at the injury site elicits an inhibitory environment for potential neuroregeneration. Besides axonal regeneration, a significant challenge in treating spinal cord injury is to replenish the neurons lost during the pathological process. However, despite decades of research efforts, current strategies including stem cell transplantation have not resulted in a successful clinical therapy. Furthermore, stem cell transplantation faces serious hurdles such as immunorejection of the transplanted cells and ethical issues. In vivo neuronal reprogramming is a recently developed technology and leading a major breakthrough in regenerative medicine. This innovative technology converts endogenous glial cells into functional neurons for injury repair in the central nervous system. The feasibility of in vivo neuronal reprogramming has been demonstrated successfully in models of different neurological disorders including spinal cord injury by numerous laboratories. Several reprogramming factors, mainly the pro-neural transcription factors, have been utilized to reprogram endogenous glial cells into functional neurons with distinct phenotypes. So far, the literature on in vivo neuronal reprogramming in the model of spinal cord injury is still small. In this review, we summarize a limited number of such reports and discuss several questions that we think are important for applying in vivo neuronal reprogramming in the research field of spinal cord injury as well as other central nervous system disorders."
Stem Cell Therapy and Immunological Rejection in Animal Models,"Jin X, Lin T, Xu Y.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a life-threatening condition that leads to permanent disability with partial or complete loss of motor, sensory, and autonomic functions. SCI is usually caused by initial mechanical insult, followed by a cascade of several neuroinflammation and structural changes. For ameliorating the neuroinflammatory cascades, MSC has been regarded as a therapeutic agent. The animal SCI research has demonstrated that MSC can be a valuable therapeutic agent with several growth factors and cytokines that may induce anti-inflammatory and regenerative effects. However, the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs in animal SCI models is inconsistent, and the optimal method of MSCs remains debatable. Moreover, there are several limitations to developing these therapeutic agents for humans. Therefore, identifying novel agents for regenerative medicine is necessary. Extracellular vesicles are a novel source for regenerative medicine; they possess nucleic acids, functional proteins, and bioactive lipids and perform various functions, including damaged tissue repair, immune response regulation, and reduction of inflammation. MSC-derived exosomes have advantages over MSCs, including small dimensions, low immunogenicity, and no need for additional procedures for culture expansion or delivery. Certain studies have demonstrated that MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, exhibit outstanding chondroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, we reviewed the principles and patho-mechanisms and summarized the research outcomes of MSCs and MSC-derived EVs for SCI, reported to date."
The activation of dormant ependymal cells following spinal cord injury,"Rodriguez-Jimenez FJ, Jendelova P, Erceg S.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to irreversible functional impairment caused by neuronal loss and the disruption of neuronal connections across the injury site. While several experimental strategies have been used to minimize tissue damage and to enhance axonal growth and regeneration, the corticospinal projection, which is the most important voluntary motor system in humans, remains largely refractory to regenerative therapeutic interventions. To date, one of the most promising pre-clinical therapeutic strategies has been neural stem cell (NSC) therapy for SCI. Over the last decade we have found that host axons regenerate into spinal NSC grafts placed into sites of SCI. These regenerating axons form synapses with the graft, and the graft in turn extends very large numbers of new axons from the injury site over long distances into the distal spinal cord. Here we discuss the pathophysiology of SCI that makes the spinal cord refractory to spontaneous regeneration, the most recent findings of neural stem cell therapy for SCI, how it has impacted motor systems including the corticospinal tract and the implications for sensory feedback."
Concise Review: Laying the Groundwork for a First-In-Human Study of an Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Based Intervention for Spinal Cord Injury,"Tsuji O, Sugai K, Yamaguchi R, Tashiro S, Nagoshi N, Kohyama J, Iida T, Ohkubo T, Itakura G, Isoda M, Shinozaki M, Fujiyoshi K, Kanemura Y, Yamanaka S, Nakamura M, Okano H.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most debilitating problems for humans. About 6 months after the initial injury, a cascade of secondary cellular and molecular events occurs and the primary damage enters the chronic phase. Current treatments are not curative. One of the new treatment methods is the use of cell therapy, which is gradually being tested in clinical trials to improve the symptoms of SCI patients. In this review article, we investigated the effect of different cell therapy trials in improving patients' symptoms and their paraclinical indicators. In the 72 final reviewed studies with 1144 cases and 186 controls, 20 scores were recorded as outcomes. We categorized the scores into seven groups. In upper extremity motor score, daily living function, trunk stability, postural hypotension, somatosensory evoked potential, and motor evoked potential scores, the bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell therapy had a more healing effect. In the International Association of Neurorestoratology SCI Functional Rating Scale, light touch score, bowel function, decreased spasticity, Visual Analog Scale, and electromyography scores, the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell had more impact. The olfactory ensheathing cell had a greater effect on lower extremity motor score and pinprick scores than other cells. The embryonic stem cell had the greatest effect in improving the important score of the American Spinal Injury Association scale. Based on the obtained results, it seems that a special cell should be used to improve each symptom of patients with chronic SCI, and if the improvement of several harms is involved, the combination of cells may be effective. Impact statement Compared to similar review articles published so far, we reviewed the largest number of published articles, and so the largest number of cases and controls, and the variety of cells we examined was more than other published articles. We concluded that different cells are effective for improving the symptoms and paraclinical indicators of patients with chronic spinal cord injury. Bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell have had the higher overall mean effect in more scores (each in six scores). If the improvement of several harms is involved, the combination of cells may be effective."
Review of operative considerations in spinal cord stem cell therapy,"Upadhyayula PS, Martin JR, Rennert RC, Ciacci JD.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) usually results in long lasting locomotor and sensory neuron degeneration below the injury. Astrocytes normally play a decisive role in mechanical and metabolic support of neurons, but in the spinal cord they cause injury, exerting well-known detrimental effects that contribute to glial scar formation and inhibition of axon outgrowth. Cell transplantation is considered a promising approach for replacing damaged cells and promoting neuroprotective and neuroregenerative repair, but the effects of the grafted cells on local tissue and the regenerative properties of endogenous neural stem cells in the injured spinal cord are largely unknown. During the last 2 decades cumulative evidence from diverse animal models has indicated that reactive astrocytes in synergy with transplanted cells could be beneficial for injury in multiple ways, including neuroprotection and axonal growth. In this review, we specifically focus on the dual opposing roles of reactive astrocytes in SCI and how they contribute to the creation of a permissive environment when combined with transplanted cells as the influential components for a local regenerative niche. Modulation of reactive astrocyte function might represent an extremely attractive new therapy to enhance the functional outcomes in patients."
Cell Transplantation and Neuroengineering Approach for Spinal Cord Injury Treatment: A Summary of Current Laboratory Findings and Review of Literature,"Lin XY, Lai BQ, Zeng X, Che MT, Ling EA, Wu W, Zeng YS.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a sudden onset of disruption to the spinal neural tissue, leading to loss of motor control and sensory function of the body. Oxidative stress is considered a hallmark in SCI followed by a series of events, including inflammation and cellular apoptosis. Melatonin was originally discovered as a hormone produced by the pineal gland. The subcellular localization of melatonin has been identified in mitochondria, exhibiting specific onsite protection to excess mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and working as an antioxidant in diseases. The recent discovery regarding the molecular basis of ligand selectivity for melatonin receptors and the constant efforts on finding synthetic melatonin alternatives have drawn researchers' attention back to melatonin. This review outlines the application of melatonin in SCI, including 1) the relationship between the melatonin rhythm and SCI in clinic; 2) the neuroprotective role of melatonin in experimental traumatic and ischemia/reperfusion SCI, i.e., exhibiting anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptosis effects, facilitating the integrity of the blood-spinal cord barrier, ameliorating edema, preventing neural death, reducing scar formation, and promoting axon regeneration and neuroplasticity; 3) protecting gut microbiota and peripheral organs; 4) synergizing with drugs, rehabilitation training, stem cell therapy, and biomedical material engineering; and 5) the potential side effects. This comprehensive review provides new insights on melatonin as a natural antioxidant therapy in facilitating rehabilitation in SCI."
Optimizing Olfactory Ensheathing Cell Transplantation for Spinal Cord Injury Repair,"Gilmour AD, Reshamwala R, Wright AA, Ekberg JAK, St John JA.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts nerve pathways and affects sensory, motor, and autonomic function. There is currently no effective treatment for SCI. SCI occurs within three temporal periods: acute, subacute, and chronic. In each period there are different alterations in the cells, inflammatory factors, and signaling pathways within the spinal cord. Many biomaterials have been investigated in the treatment of SCI, including hydrogels and fiber scaffolds, and some progress has been made in the treatment of SCI using multiple materials. However, there are limitations when using individual biomaterials in SCI treatment, and these limitations can be significantly improved by combining treatments with stem cells. In order to better understand SCI and to investigate new strategies for its treatment, several combination therapies that include materials combined with cells, drugs, cytokines, etc. are summarized in the current review."
Stem cell therapy for spinal cord injury,"Kan EM, Ling EA, Lu J.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a severely disabling and catastrophic condition that poses significant global clinical challenges. The difficulty of SCI repair results from the distinctive pathophysiological mechanisms, which are characterised by limited regenerative capacity and inadequate neuroplasticity of the spinal cord. Additionally, the formation of cystic cavities and astrocytic scars after SCI further obstructs both the ascending and descending neural conduction pathways. Consequently, the urgent challenge in post-SCI recovery lies in repairing the damaged spinal cord to reconstruct a functional and intact neural conduction circuit. In recent years, significant advancements in biological tissue engineering technology and novel therapies have resulted in a transformative shift in the field of SCI repair. Currently, SCI treatment primarily involves drug therapy, stem cell therapy, the use of biological materials, growth factors, and other approaches. This paper comprehensively reviews the progress in SCI research over the years, with a particular focus on the concept of Spinal Cord Fusion"" as a promising technique for SCI reconstruction. By discussing this important research progress and the neurological mechanisms involved"
Plasticity and regeneration in the injured spinal cord after cell transplantation therapy,"Nori S, Nakamura M, Okano H.","AB  - OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of different stem cell types for spinal cord injury (SCI) therapy to determine the superior treatment of SCI. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, VIP, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wan Fang databases from initiation to January 30, 2021. A Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed using ADDIS (Aggregate Data Drug Information System) software. The PROSPERO registration number was CRD42020129635. RESULTS: We included 12 studies with 642 patients in the present study. A network meta-analysis revealed that bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) combined with rehabilitation training were significantly more effective than rehabilitation training alone in improving the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale grade (odds ratio, 94.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.71-9321.95), ASIA motor score (weighted mean difference [WMD], 6.67; 95% CI, 0.83-12.73), ASIA sensory functional score (WMD, 12.41; 95% CI, 3.42-21.72), and Barthel index (WMD, 7.24; 95% CI, 0.21-14.30). However, no statistically significant differences were observed between bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNCs) combined with rehabilitation training, umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs) combined with rehabilitation training, or UCMSCs alone and rehabilitation alone for all indicators. In terms of safety, there were no serious and permanent adverse effects after transplantation of BMSCs, MNCs, or UCMSCs. CONCLUSIONS: BMSCs plus rehabilitation might be superior to other stem cell treatments of SCI in improving the ASIA impairment scale grade, ASIA motor score, ASIA sensory functional score, and Barthel index. The therapeutic effects of UCMSCs and MNCs remain to be confirmed."
"A Systematic Review of Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Spinal Cord Injury, Intervertebral Disc Repair and Spinal Fusion","Khan S, Mafi P, Mafi R, Khan W.","AB  - AIMS: To summarize the evidence on the efficacy and safety of neural stem cell therapy (NSCT) for the treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI). METHODS: A systematic literature review of Medline®, EMBASE® and Cochrane library was performed to identify studies reporting efficacy and safety of NSCT in SCI. Articles were included if they reported efficacy and safety data of SCI patients who received NSCT. RESULTS: Overall, four studies of the 277 records met all the study eligibility criteria. Over the 1-year follow-up period, motor scores were significantly higher among patients who received NSCT compared with those who did not (American Spinal Injury Association [ASIA] motor scores (mean±standard deviation [SD]): 7.9±1.2 versus 3.9±0.6; upper extremity motor score: 7.8±2.1 versus 3.9±0.6, both P<0.05). Sensory scores (pinprick score: 4.8±1.3 versus 2.9±0.6; P=0.5; light touch score: 6.9±3.1 versus 2.3±0.5, P=0.3), ASIA impairment scale (26% versus 7%) or pain score (baseline: 2.4±0.6; 1-year: 3.4±0.4) were comparable in both NSCT and non-NSCT cohorts. Over the 1-year follow-up period, the graded redefined assessment of strength, sensibility, and prehension and international standards for neurological classification of SCI scores showed a mean improvement of 14.8 and 17.8 points respectively. Overall, treatment with NSCT showed favorable safety and tolerability profile. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the limited and poor-quality evidence, it is too early to make robust conclusions on the efficacy of NSCT in the treatment of SCI. However, based on the included studies, NSCT seems to be a potential option worth exploring among patients with SCI. Nonetheless, prospective, randomized trials in larger cohorts are needed to validate the efficacy and safety of NSCT in the treatment of SCI."
Role of dendritic cells in spinal cord injury,"Han X, Zhang M, Yan L, Fu Y, Kou H, Shang C, Wang J, Liu H, Jiang C, Wang J, Cheng T.","AB  - Ependymal cells, a dormant population of ciliated progenitors found within the central canal of the spinal cord, undergo significant alterations after spinal cord injury (SCI). Understanding the molecular events that induce ependymal cell activation after SCI represents the first step toward controlling the response of the endogenous regenerative machinery in damaged tissues. This response involves the activation of specific signaling pathways in the spinal cord that promotes self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation. We review our current understanding of the signaling pathways and molecular events that mediate the SCI-induced activation of ependymal cells by focusing on the roles of some cell adhesion molecules, cellular membrane receptors, ion channels (and their crosstalk), and transcription factors. An orchestrated response regulating the expression of receptors and ion channels fine-tunes and coordinates the activation of ependymal cells after SCI or cell transplantation. Understanding the major players in the activation of ependymal cells may help us to understand whether these cells represent a critical source of cells contributing to cellular replacement and tissue regeneration after SCI. A more complete understanding of the role and function of individual signaling pathways in endogenous spinal cord progenitors may foster the development of novel targeted therapies to induce the regeneration of the injured spinal cord."

As the holy grail of regenerative medicine, promoting spinal cord tissue regeneration and functional recovery are the fundamental goals. Yet, effective regeneration of injured spinal cord tissues and promotion of functional recovery remain unmet clinical challenges, largely due to the complex pathophysiology of the condition. The transplantation of various cells, either alone or in combination with three-dimensional matrices, has been intensively investigated in preclinical SCI models and clinical trials, holding translational promise.

Restoring Motor Neurons in Spinal Cord Injury With Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells,"Trawczynski M, Liu G, David BT, Fessler RG.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a profound medical condition that significantly hampers motor function, imposing substantial limitations on daily activities and exerting a considerable financial burden on patients and their families. The constrained regenerative capacity of endogenous spinal cord tissue, exacerbated by the inflammatory response following the initial trauma, poses a formidable obstacle to effective therapy. Recent advancements in the field, stem cells, biomaterials, and molecular therapy, show promising outcomes. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine approaches for SCI treatment, including cell transplantation, tissue-engineered construct implantation, and other potential therapeutic strategies. Additionally, it sheds light on preclinical animal studies and recent clinical trials incorporating these modalities, providing a glimpse into the evolving landscape of SCI management. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The investigation into spinal cord injury (SCI) treatments focuses on reducing long-term impacts by targeting scar inhibition and enhancing regeneration through stem cells, with or without growth factors. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) show promise for autologous use, with clinical trials confirming their safety. Challenges include low cell viability and difficulty in targeted differentiation. Biomaterial scaffolds hold potential for improving cell viability and integration, and extracellular vesicles (EVs) are emerging as a novel therapy. While EV research is in its early stages, stem cell trials demonstrate safety and potential recovery. Advancing tissue engineering approaches with biomaterial scaffolds is crucial for human trials."
Biomaterials reinforced MSCs transplantation for spinal cord injury repair,"Ma T, Wu J, Mu J, Gao J.","AB  - A large body of work has been published on transplantation of a wide range of neural stem and progenitor cell types derived from the developing and adult CNS, as well as from pluripotent embryonic stem cells, in models of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). However, many of these cell-based approaches present practical issues for clinical translation such as ethical cell derivation, generation of potentially large numbers of homogenously prepared cells, and immune rejection. With the advent of induced Pluripotent Stem (iPS) cell technology, many of these issues may potentially be overcome. To date, a number of studies have demonstrated integration, differentiation into mature CNS lineages, migration and long-term safety of iPS cell transplants in a variety of SCI models, as well as therapeutic benefits in some cases. Given the clinical potential of this advance in stem cell biology, we present a concise review of studies published to date involving iPS cell transplantation in animal models of SCI."
Nanotechnology for the Treatment of Spinal Cord Injury,"Zimmermann R, Vieira Alves Y, Sperling LE, Pranke P.","AB  - Electrospinning is the process by which a scaffold containing micrometer and nanometer diameter fibers are drawn from a polymer solution or melt using a large voltage gradient between a polymer emitting source and a grounded collector. Ramakrishna and colleagues first investigated electrospun fibers for neural applications in 2004. After this initial study, electrospun fibers are increasingly investigated for neural tissue engineering applications. Electrospun fibers robustly support axonal regeneration within in vivo rodent models of spinal cord injury. These findings suggest the possibility of their eventual use within patients. Indeed, both spinal cord and peripheral nervous system regeneration research over the last several years shows that physical guidance cues induce recovery of limb, respiration, or bladder control in rodent models. Electrospun fibers may be an alternative to the peripheral nerve graft (PNG), because PNG autografts injure the patient and are limited in supply, and allografts risk host rejection. In addition, electrospun fibers can be engineered easily to confront new therapeutic challenges. Fibers can be modified to release therapies locally or can be physically modified to direct neural stem cell differentiation. This review summarizes the major findings and trends in the last decade of research, with a particular focus on spinal cord injury. This review also demonstrates how electrospun fibers can be used to study the central nervous system in vitro."
The translational landscape in spinal cord injury: focus on neuroplasticity and regeneration,"Hutson TH, Di Giovanni S.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is associated with currently irreversible consequences in several functional components of the central nervous system. Despite the severity of injury, there remains no approved treatment to restore function. However, with a growing number of preclinical studies and clinical trials, cell transplantation has gained significant potential as a treatment for SCI. Researchers have identified several cell types as potential candidates for transplantation. To optimize successful functional outcomes after transplantation, one key factor concerns generating neuronal cells with regional and subtype specificity, thus calling on the developmental transcriptome patterning of spinal cord cells. A potential source of spinal cord cells for transplantation is the generation of exogenic neuronal progenitor cells via the emerging technologies of gene editing and blastocyst complementation. This review highlights the use of cell transplantation to treat SCI in the context of relevant developmental gene expression patterns useful for producing regionally specific exogenic spinal cells via in vitro differentiation and blastocyst complementation."
Spinal Cord Injury Management Based on Microglia-Targeting Therapies,"Schreiner TG, Schreiner OD, Ciobanu RC.","AB  - Cell transplantation constitutes an important avenue for development of new treatments for spinal cord injury (SCI). These therapies are aimed at supporting neural repair and/or replacing lost cells at the injury site. To date, various cell types have been trialed, with most studies focusing on different types of stem cells or glial cells. Here, we review commonly used cell transplantation approaches for spinal cord injury (SCI) repair, with focus on transplantation of olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), the glial cells of the primary olfactory nervous system. OECs are promising candidates for promotion of neural repair given that they support continuous regeneration of the olfactory nerve that occurs throughout life. Further, OECs can be accessed from the nasal mucosa (olfactory neuroepithelium) at the roof of the nasal cavity and can be autologously transplanted. OEC transplantation has been trialed in many animal models of SCI, as well as in human clinical trials. While several studies have been promising, outcomes are variable and the method needs improvement to enhance aspects such as cell survival, integration, and migration. As a case study, we include the approaches used by our team (the Clem Jones Centre for Neurobiology and Stem Cell Research, Griffith University, Nathan, QLD, Australia) to address the current problems with OEC transplantation and discuss how the therapeutic potential of OEC transplantation can be improved. Our approach includes discovery research to improve our knowledge of OEC biology, identifying natural and synthetic compounds to stimulate the neural repair properties of OECs, and designing three-dimensional cell constructs to create stable and transplantable cell structures."
Biomaterial-supported MSC transplantation enhances cell-cell communication for spinal cord injury,"Lv B, Zhang X, Yuan J, Chen Y, Ding H, Cao X, Huang A.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts neurological pathways and impacts sensory, motor, and autonomic nerve function. There is no effective treatment for SCI currently. Numerous endogenous cells, including astrocytes, macrophages/microglia, and oligodendrocyte, are involved in the histological healing process following SCI. By interfering with cells during the SCI repair process, some advancements in the therapy of SCI have been realized. Nevertheless, the endogenous cell types engaged in SCI repair and the current difficulties these cells confront in the therapy of SCI are poorly defined, and the mechanisms underlying them are little understood. In order to better understand SCI and create new therapeutic strategies and enhance the clinical translation of SCI repair, we have comprehensively listed the endogenous cells involved in SCI repair and summarized the six most common mechanisms involved in SCI repair, including limiting the inflammatory response, protecting the spared spinal cord, enhancing myelination, facilitating neovascularization, producing neurotrophic factors, and differentiating into neural/colloidal cell lines."
Repair of the injured spinal cord and the potential of embryonic stem cell transplantation,"McDonald JW, Becker D, Holekamp TF, Howard M, Liu S, Lu A, Lu J, Platik MM, Qu Y, Stewart T, Vadivelu S.","AB  - A long-standing goal of spinal cord injury research is to develop effective repair strategies, which can restore motor and sensory functions to near-normal levels. Recent advances in clinical management of spinal cord injury have significantly improved the prognosis, survival rate and quality of life in patients with spinal cord injury. In addition, a significant progress in basic science research has unraveled the underlying cellular and molecular events of spinal cord injury. Such efforts enabled the development of pharmacologic agents, biomaterials and stem-cell based therapy. Despite these efforts, there is still no standard care to regenerate axons or restore function of silent axons in the injured spinal cord. These challenges led to an increased focus on another therapeutic approach, namely neuromodulation. In multiple animal models of spinal cord injury, epidural electrical stimulation of the spinal cord has demonstrated a recovery of motor function. Emerging evidence regarding the efficacy of epidural electrical stimulation has further expanded the potential of epidural electrical stimulation for treating patients with spinal cord injury. However, most clinical studies were conducted on a very small number of patients with a wide range of spinal cord injury. Thus, subsequent studies are essential to evaluate the therapeutic potential of epidural electrical stimulation for spinal cord injury and to optimize stimulation parameters. Here, we discuss cellular and molecular events that continue to damage the injured spinal cord and impede neurological recovery following spinal cord injury. We also discuss and summarize the animal and human studies that evaluated epidural electrical stimulation in spinal cord injury."
Roles of Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Spinal Cord Injury,"Qu J, Zhang H.","AB  - Spinal surgery presents a challenge for both neurosurgery and orthopaedic surgery. Due to the heterogeneous differentiation potential of mesenchymal stem cells, there is much interest in the treatment of spine surgery. Animal and human trials focussing on the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells in spinal cord injury, spine fusion and disc degeneration were included in this systematic review. Published articles up to January 2016 from MEDLINE, PubMed and Ovid were used by searching for specific terms. Of the 2595 articles found, 53 met the selection criteria and were included for analysis (16 on spinal cord injury, 28 on intervertebral disc repair and 9 on spinal fusion). Numerous studies reported better results when the mesenchymal stem cells were used in co-culture with other cells or used in scaffolds. Mesenchymal stem cells were also found to have an immune-modulatory role, which can improve surgical outcome. This systematic review suggests that mesenchymal stem cells can be used safely and effectively for these spinal surgery treatments. Whilst, in certain studies, mesenchymal stem cells did not necessarily show improved results from existing treatments, they provide an alternative option. This can reduce morbidity that arises from current surgical treatment."

However, regeneration of the injured spinal cord is approaching reality according to the advances in stem cell biology. Cell transplantation therapy holds potential to lead to recovery following SCI through some positive mechanisms. Grafted cells induce plasticity and regeneration in the injured spinal cord by promoting remyelination of damaged axons, reconstruction of neural circuits by synapse formation between host neurons and graft-derived neurons, and secreting neurotrophic factors to promote axonal elongation as well as reduce retrograde axonal degeneration. In this review, we will delineate (1) the microenvironment of the injured spinal cord that influence the plasticity and regeneration capacity after SCI, (2) a number of different kinds of cell transplantation therapies for SCI that has been extensively studied by researchers, and (3) potential mechanisms of grafted cell-induced regeneration and plasticity in the injured spinal cord."
Multimodal treatment for spinal cord injury: a sword of neuroregeneration upon neuromodulation,"Zheng Y, Mao YR, Yuan TF, Xu DS, Cheng LM.","AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A narrative review. OBJECTIVE: To summarize relevant data from representative studies investigating upper limb restorative therapies for cervical spinal cord injury. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating condition resulting in tetraplegia, lifelong disability, and reduced quality of life. Given the dependence of all activities on hand function, patients with tetraplegia rank regaining hand function as one of their highest priorities. Recovery from cervical SCI is heterogeneous and often incomplete; currently, various novel therapies are under investigation to improve neurological function and eventually better quality of life in patients with tetraplegia. METHODS: In this article, a narrative literature review was performed to identify treatment options targeting the restoration of function in patients with cervical SCI. Studies were included from available literature based on the availability of clinical data and whether they are applicable to restoration of arm and hand function in patients with cervical SCI. RESULTS: We describe relevant studies including indications and outcomes with a focus on arm and hand function. Different treatment modalities described include nerve transfers, tendon transfers, spinal cord stimulation, functional electrical stimulation, non-invasive brain stimulation, brain-machine interfaces and neuroprosthetics, stem cell therapy, and immunotherapy. As the authors' institution leads one of the largest clinical trials on nerve transfers for cervical SCI, we also describe how patients undergoing nerve transfers are managed and followed at our center. CONCLUSIONS: While complete recovery from cervical spinal cord injury may not be possible, novel therapies aimed at the restoration of upper limb motor function have made significant progress toward the realization of complete recovery."

The challenges of translating stem cells for spinal cord injury and related disorders: what are the barriers and opportunities?,"Hewson SM, Fehlings LN, Messih M, Fehlings MG.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating neurological disorder that damages motor, sensory, and autonomic pathways. Recent advances in stem cell therapy have allowed for the in vitro generation of motor neurons (MNs) showing electrophysiological and synaptic activity, expression of canonical MN biomarkers, and the ability to graft into spinal lesions. Clinical translation, especially the transplantation of MN precursors in spinal lesions, has thus far been elusive because of stem cell heterogeneity and protocol variability, as well as a hostile microenvironment such as inflammation and scarring, which yield inconsistent pre-clinical results without a consensus best-practice therapeutic strategy. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in particular have lower ethical and immunogenic concerns than other stem cells, which could make them more clinically applicable. In this review, we focus on the differentiation of iPSCs into neural precursors, MN progenitors, mature MNs, and MN subtype fates. Previous reviews have summarized MN development and differentiation, but an up-to-date summary of technological and experimental advances holding promise for bench-to-bedside translation, especially those targeting individual MN subtypes in SCI, is currently lacking. We discuss biological mechanisms of MN lineage, recent experimental protocols and techniques for MN differentiation from iPSCs, and transplantation of neural precursors and MN lineage cells in spinal cord lesions to restore motor function. We emphasize efficient, clinically safe, and personalized strategies for the application of MN and their subtypes as therapy in spinal lesions."

All of these strategies when used separately would help rebuild, to some extent, the neural circuits in the lesion area of the spinal cord. In light of this, it is generally accepted that a combined treatment may be a more effective strategy. This review focuses primarily on our recent series of work on transplantation of Schwann cells and adult stem cells, and transplantation of stem cell-derived neural network scaffolds with functional synapses. Arising from this, an artificial neural network (an exogenous neuronal relay) has been designed and fabricated by us-a biomaterial scaffold implanted with Schwann cells modified by the neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) gene and adult stem cells modified with the TrkC (receptor of NT-3) gene. More importantly, experimental evidence suggests that the novel artificial network can integrate with the host tissue and serve as an exogenous neuronal relay for signal transfer and functional improvement of SCI."
"Adverse events of cell therapy clinical trials in human chronic spinal cord injury, a systematic review and meta-analysis","Davoudi-Monfared E, Abolghasemi R, Allahyari F, Farzanegan G.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a serious neurological condition comprising primary and secondary injury and causing severe neurological impairments. The effect of the conventional treatment is limited, including supportive therapy and emergency surgery. Exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs-Exos) were previously reported to exert its potential therapeutic effects on SCI. Compared with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation for SCI, MSC-Exos showed several superiorities. In the present review, we summarized the revealed data of mechanisms underlying MSC-Exos repairing of SCI and discussed the issues of MSC-Exos use. Thus, in this review we summarized the latest studies on MSCs-Exos in the therapy of SCI and discussed whether MSCs-Exos can be applied to SCI and the prospects of transformation application."
Emerging Therapeutic Strategies for Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury,"Torregrossa F, Sallì M, Grasso G.","AB  - Over the past decade, we have witnessed a flourishing of novel strategies to enhance neuroplasticity and promote axon regeneration following spinal cord injury, and results from preclinical studies suggest that some of these strategies have the potential for clinical translation. Spinal cord injury leads to the disruption of neural circuitry and connectivity, resulting in permanent neurological disability. Recovery of function relies on augmenting neuroplasticity to potentiate sprouting and regeneration of spared and injured axons, to increase the strength of residual connections and to promote the formation of new connections and circuits. Neuroplasticity can be fostered by exploiting four main biological properties: neuronal intrinsic signalling, the neuronal extrinsic environment, the capacity to reconnect the severed spinal cord via neural stem cell grafts, and modulation of neuronal activity. In this Review, we discuss experimental evidence from rodents, nonhuman primates and patients regarding interventions that target each of these four properties. We then highlight the strengths and challenges of individual and combinatorial approaches with respect to clinical translation. We conclude by considering future developments and providing views on how to bridge the gap between preclinical studies and clinical translation."
Clinical Trials Using Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Spinal Cord Injury: Challenges in Generating Evidence,"de Araújo LT, Macêdo CT, Damasceno PKF, das Neves ÍGC, de Lima CS, Santos GC, de Santana TA, Sampaio GLA, Silva DN, Villarreal CF, Chaguri ACC, da Silva CG, Mota ACA, Badaró R, Ribeiro Dos Santos R, Soares MBP.","AB  - With their capability to undergo unlimited self-renew and to differentiate into various functional cells, human pluripotent stem cells, including embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), hold great promise in regenerative medicine to treat currently incurable diseases. Significant progress has been achieved in differentiating pluripotent stem cells into various functional cells, such as pancreatic β cells, neural cells, hepatocytes, and cardiomyocytes. In addition, three hESC-based therapies to treat spinal cord injury, macular degeneration and type 1 diabetes have entered clinical trial. However, there remain several major bottlenecks that hinder the clinical trial of stem cell based therapy. One such key challenge is the immune rejection of cells derived from allogeneic hESCs. The challenge of immune rejection is mitigated by recent discovery of iPSCs, raising the hope that patient-specific hiPSCs can be differentiated into autologous cells for transplantation into the same patient without the concern of immune rejection. However, due to the oncogenic potential of the reprogramming factors and the reprogramming- induced DNA damage, there remain safety concerns about the cancer risk and immunogenicity of hiPSC-derived cells. This review discusses recent progress in our understanding of the immunogenicity of pluripotent stem cells and the development of new strategies to resolve this challenge."
Current Concepts of Biomaterial Scaffolds and Regenerative Therapy for Spinal Cord Injury,"Suzuki H, Imajo Y, Funaba M, Ikeda H, Nishida N, Sakai T.","AB  - BACKGROUND: How much scientific evidence is there to show that stem cell therapy is sufficient in preclinical and clinical studies of spinal cord injury before it is translated into clinical practice? This is a complicated problem. A single, small-sample clinical trial is difficult to answer, and accurate insights into this question can only be given by systematically evaluating all the existing evidence. METHODS: The PubMed, Ovid-Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases were searched from inception to February 10, 2022. Two independent reviewers performed the literature search, identified and screened the studies, and performed a quality assessment and data extraction. RESULTS: In total, 62 studies involving 2439 patients were included in the analysis. Of these, 42 were single-arm studies, and 20 were controlled studies. The meta-analysis showed that stem cells improved the ASIA impairment scale score by at least one grade in 48.9% [40.8%, 56.9%] of patients with spinal cord injury. Moreover, the rate of improvement in urinary and gastrointestinal system function was 42.1% [27.6%, 57.2%] and 52.0% [23.6%, 79.8%], respectively. However, 28 types of adverse effects were observed to occur due to stem cells and transplantation procedures. Of these, neuropathic pain, abnormal feeling, muscle spasms, vomiting, and urinary tract infection were the most common, with an incidence of > 20%. While no serious adverse effects such as tumorigenesis were reported, this could be due to the insufficient follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results demonstrated that although the efficacy of stem cell therapy is encouraging, the subsequent adverse effects remain concerning. In addition, the clinical trials had problems such as small sample sizes, poor design, and lack of prospective registration, control, and blinding. Therefore, the current evidence is not sufficiently strong to support the clinical translation of stem cell therapy for spinal cord injury, and several problems remain. Additional well-designed animal experiments and high-quality clinical studies are warranted to address these issues."
The role of Wnt/mTOR signaling in spinal cord injury,"Cheng P, Liao HY, Zhang HH.","AB  - Traditionally, treatment of spinal cord injury seemed frustrating and hopeless because of the remarkable morbidity and mortality, and restricted therapeutic options. Recent advances in neural injury and repair, and the progress towards development of neuroprotective and regenerative interventions are basis for increased optimism. Neural stem cells have opened a new arena of discovery for the field of regenerative science and medicine. Embryonic stem (ES) cells can give rise to all neural progenitors and they represent an important scientific tool for approaching neural repair. The growing number of dedicated regeneration centers worldwide exemplifies the changing perception towards the do-ability of spinal cord repair and this review was born from a presentation at one such leading center, the Kentucky Spinal Cord Injury Research Center. Current concepts of the pathophysiology, repair, and restoration of function in the damaged spinal cord are presented with an overlay of how neural stem cells, particularly ES cells, fit into the picture as important scientific tools and therapeutic targets. We focus on the use of genetically tagged and selectable ES cell lines for neural induction and transplantation. Unique features of ES cells, including indefinite replication, pluripotency, and genetic flexibility, provide strong tools to address questions of neural repair. Selective marker expression in transplanted ES cell derived neural cells is providing new insights into transplantation and repair not possible previously. These features of ES cells will produce a predictable and explosive growth in scientific tools that will translate into discoveries and rapid progress in neural repair."
Stem cell therapy and coordination dynamics therapy to improve spinal cord injury,Schalow G.,"AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) damages axons and disrupts myelination interrupting sensory and motor neuronal transmission to and from the brain. Patients suffering from SCI although continue to survive, are often left chronically disabled and with no promise of a cure. Advances in stem cell biology has opened up doors for the use of human embryonic, adult neural and induced pluripotent stem cell strategies for SCI. Despite great promise from animal research, clinical trials have been limited and the jury is still out on its safety and efficacy. This review discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the various stem cell types, barriers hindering translation from animal to humans, and the need for established guidelines for standardization of clinical trials ensuring subsequent implementation. Ultimately, unrealistic expectations of stem cell therapy (SCT) as the elixir for SCI should be managed. The success of SCT for SCI lies in the network of research scientists, medical professionals and patients working cooperatively to build up a knowledge-intensive platform for a comprehensive risk-benefit assessment of SCT for SCI."
Epidermal neural crest stem cells and their use in mouse models of spinal cord injury,Sieber-Blum M.,"AB  - BACKGROUND AIMS: The authors aim to analyze the evidence in the literature regarding the efficacy and safety of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy in human subjects with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) and identify its potential role in the management of SCI. METHODS: The authors conducted independent and duplicate searches of electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library, until May 2020 for studies analyzing the efficacy and safety of stem cell therapy for SCI. American Spine Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale (AIS) grade improvement, ASIA sensorimotor score, activities of daily living score, residual urine volume, bladder function improvement, somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) improvement and adverse reactions were the outcomes analyzed. Analysis was performed in R platform using OpenMeta[Analyst] software. RESULTS: Nineteen studies involving 670 patients were included for analysis. On analysis, the intervention group showed statistically significant improvement in AIS grade (P < 0.001), ASIA sensory score (P < 0.017), light touch (P < 0.001), pinprick (P = 0.046), bladder function (P = 0.012), residual urine volume (P = 0.023) and SSEP (P = 0.002). However, no significant difference was noted in motor score (P = 0.193) or activities of daily living score (P = 0.161). Although the intervention group had a significant increase in complications (P < 0.001), no serious or permanent adverse events were reported. On subgroup analysis, low concentration of MSCs (<5 × 10(7) cells) and initial AIS grade A presentation showed significantly better outcomes than their counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' analysis establishes the efficacy and safety of MSC transplantation in terms of improvement in AIS grade, ASIA sensory score, bladder function and electrophysiological parameters like SSEP compared with controls, without major adverse events. However, further research is needed to standardize dose, timing, route and source of MSCs used for transplantation."

Epigenetic regulation of neural stem cell differentiation towards spinal cord regeneration,"Kameda T, Imamura T, Nakashima K.","AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinal cord injuries incite varying degrees of symptoms in patients, ranging from weakness and incoordination to paralysis. Common amongst spinal cord injury (SCI) patients, neuropathic pain (NP) is a debilitating medical condition. Unfortunately, there remain many clinical impediments in treating NP because there is a lack of understanding regarding the mechanisms behind SCI-induced NP (SCINP). Given that more than 450,000 people in the United States alone suffer from SCI, it is unsatisfactory that current treatments yield poor results in alleviating and treating NP. SUMMARY: In this review, we briefly discussed the models of SCINP along with the mechanisms of NP progression. Further, current treatment modalities are herein explored for SCINP involving pharmacological interventions targeting glia cells and astrocytes. KEY MESSAGE: The studies presented in this review provide insight for new directions regarding SCINP alleviation. Given the severity and incapacitating effects of SCINP, it is imperative to study the pathways involved and find new therapeutic targets in coordination with stem cell research, and to develop a new gold-standard in SCINP treatment."
Meta-analysis of stem cell transplantation for reflex hypersensitivity after spinal cord injury,"Chen X, Xue B, Li Y, Song C, Jia P, Ren X, Zang W, Wang J.","AB  - Spinal cord injury is a significant cause of motor dysfunctions. There is no definite cure for it, and most of the therapeutic modalities are only symptomatic treatment. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the effectiveness of stem cell therapy in the treatment of the spinal cord injuries in animal models was studied and evaluated. A systematic search through medical databases by using appropriate keywords was conducted. The relevant reports were reviewed in order to find out cases in which inclusion and exclusion criteria had been fulfilled. Finally, 89 articles have been considered, from which 28 had sufficient data for performing statistical analyses. The findings showed a significant improvement in motor functions after cell therapy. The outcome was strongly related to the number of transplanted cells, site of injury, chronicity of the injury, type of the damage, and the induction of immune-suppression. According to our data, improvements in functional recovery after stem cell therapy in the treatment of spinal cord injury in animal models was noticeable, but its outcome is strongly related to the site of injury, number of transplanted cells, and type of transplanted cells."
Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells and the treatment of spinal cord injury,"Cao FJ, Feng SQ.","AB  - Spinal cord injury is linked to the interruption of neural pathways, which results in irreversible neural dysfunction. Neural repair and neuroregeneration are critical goals and issues for rehabilitation in spinal cord injury, which require neural stem cell repair and multimodal neuromodulation techniques involving personalized rehabilitation strategies. Besides the involvement of endogenous stem cells in neurogenesis and neural repair, exogenous neural stem cell transplantation is an emerging effective method for repairing and replacing damaged tissues in central nervous system diseases. However, to ensure that endogenous or exogenous neural stem cells truly participate in neural repair following spinal cord injury, appropriate interventional measures (e.g., neuromodulation) should be adopted. Neuromodulation techniques, such as noninvasive magnetic stimulation and electrical stimulation, have been safely applied in many neuropsychiatric diseases. There is increasing evidence to suggest that neuromagnetic/electrical modulation promotes neuroregeneration and neural repair by affecting signaling in the nervous system; namely, by exciting, inhibiting, or regulating neuronal and neural network activities to improve motor function and motor learning following spinal cord injury. Several studies have indicated that fine motor skill rehabilitation training makes use of residual nerve fibers for collateral growth, encourages the formation of new synaptic connections to promote neural plasticity, and improves motor function recovery in patients with spinal cord injury. With the development of biomaterial technology and biomechanical engineering, several emerging treatments have been developed, such as robots, brain-computer interfaces, and nanomaterials. These treatments have the potential to help millions of patients suffering from motor dysfunction caused by spinal cord injury. However, large-scale clinical trials need to be conducted to validate their efficacy. This review evaluated the efficacy of neural stem cells and magnetic or electrical stimulation combined with rehabilitation training and intelligent therapies for spinal cord injury according to existing evidence, to build up a multimodal treatment strategy of spinal cord injury to enhance nerve repair and regeneration."
Tissue Engineering and Stem Cell Therapy in Neurogenic Bladder Dysfunction: Current and Future Perspectives,"Topoliova K, Harsanyi S, Danisovic L, Ziaran S.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) represents one of the most complicated and heterogeneous pathological processes of central nervous system (CNS) impairments, which is still beyond functional regeneration. Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been shown to promote the repair of the injured spinal cord tissues in animal models, and therefore, there is much interest in the clinical use of these cells. However, many questions which are essential to improve the therapy effects remain unanswered. For instance, the functional roles and related molecular regulatory mechanisms of MSCs in vivo are not yet completely determined. It is important for transplanted cells to migrate into the injured tissue, to survive and undergo neural differentiation, or to play neural protection roles by various mechanisms after SCI. In this review, we will focus on some of the recent knowledge about the biological behavior and function of MSCs in SCI. Meanwhile, we highlight the function of biomaterials to direct the behavior of MSCs based on our series of work on silk fibroin biomaterials and attempt to emphasize combinational strategies such as tissue engineering for functional improvement of SCI."
Cell transplantation for spinal cord injury: a systematic review,"Li J, Lepski G.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a catastrophic condition associated with significant neurological deficit and social and financial burdens. It is currently being managed symptomatically, with no real therapeutic strategies available. In recent years, a number of innovative regenerative strategies have emerged and have been continuously investigated in preclinical research and clinical trials. In the near future, several more are expected to come down the translational pipeline. Among ongoing and completed trials are those reporting the use of biomaterial scaffolds. The advancements in biomaterial technology, combined with stem cell therapy or other regenerative therapy, can now accelerate the progress of promising novel therapeutic strategies from bench to bedside. Various types of approaches to regeneration therapy for SCI have been combined with the use of supportive biomaterial scaffolds as a drug and cell delivery system to facilitate favorable cell-material interactions and the supportive effect of neuroprotection. In this review, we summarize some of the most recent insights of preclinical and clinical studies using biomaterial scaffolds in regenerative therapy for SCI and summarized the biomaterial strategies for treatment with simplified results data.

Effects of cytokines and chemokines on migration of mesenchymal stem cells following spinal cord injury,"Li L, Yang M, Wang C, Zhao Q, Liu J, Zhan C, Liu Z, Li X, Wang W, Yang X.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating neurologic condition with tremendous socioeconomic impact on affected individuals and the health care system. The treatment of SCI principally includes surgical treatment and marginal pharmacologic and rehabilitation therapies targeting secondary events with minor clinical improvements. This unsuccessful result mainly reflects the complexity of SCI pathophysiology and the diverse biochemical and physiologic changes that occur in the injured spinal cord. Once the nervous system is injured, cascades of cellular and molecular events are triggered at varying times. Although the cascade of tissue reactions and cell injury develops over a period of days or weeks, the most extensive cell death in SCI occurs within hours of trauma. This situation suggests that early intervention is likely to be the most promising approach to rescue the cord from further and irreversible cell damage. Over the past decades, a wealth of research has been conducted in preclinical and clinical studies with the hope to find new therapeutic strategies. Researchers have identified several targets for the development of potential therapeutic interventions (e.g., neuroprotection, replacement of cells lost, removal of inhibitory molecules, regeneration, and rehabilitation strategies to induce neuroplasticity). Most of these treatments have passed preclinical and initial clinical evaluations but have failed to be strongly conclusive in the clinical setting. This narrative review provides an update of the many therapeutic interventions after SCI, with an emphasis on the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms."
Precursor cell biology and the development of astrocyte transplantation therapies: lessons from spinal cord injury,"Noble M, Davies JE, Mayer-Pröschel M, Pröschel C, Davies SJ.","AB  - Lower motor neuron (LMN) damage results in denervation of the associated muscle targets and is a significant yet under-appreciated component of spinal cord injury (SCI). Denervated muscle undergoes a progressive degeneration and fibro-fatty infiltration that eventually renders the muscle non-viable unless reinnervated within a limited time window. The distal nerve deprived of axons also undergoes degeneration and fibrosis making it less receptive to axons. In this review, we describe the LMN injury associated with SCI and its clinical consequences. The process of degeneration of the muscle and nerve is broken down into the primary components of the neuromuscular circuit and reviewed, including the nerve and Schwann cells, the neuromuscular junction, and the muscle. Finally, we discuss three promising strategies to reverse denervation atrophy. These include providing surrogate axons from local sources; introducing stem cell-derived spinal motor neurons into the nerve to provide the missing axons; and finally, instituting a training program of high-energy electrical stimulation to directly rehabilitate these muscles. Successful interventions for denervation atrophy would significantly expand reconstructive options for cervical SCI and could be transformative for the predominantly LMN injuries of the conus medullaris and cauda equina."
Current trends in spinal cord injury repair,"Yu WY, He DW.","AB  - The spinal cord is part of the central nervous system (CNS) and serves to connect the brain to the peripheral nervous system and peripheral tissues. The cell types that primarily comprise the spinal cord are neurons and several categories of glia, including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia. Ependymal cells and small populations of endogenous stem cells, such as oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, also reside in the spinal cord. Neurons are interconnected in circuits; those that process cutaneous sensory input are mainly located in the dorsal spinal cord, while those involved in proprioception and motor control are predominately located in the ventral spinal cord. Due to the importance of the spinal cord, neurodegenerative disorders and traumatic injuries affecting the spinal cord will lead to motor deficits and loss of sensory inputs.Spinal cord injury (SCI), resulting in paraplegia and tetraplegia as a result of deleterious interconnected mechanisms encompassed by the primary and secondary injury, represents a heterogeneously behavioral and cognitive deficit that remains incurable. Following SCI, various barriers containing the neuroinflammation, neural tissue defect (neurons, microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes), cavity formation, loss of neuronal circuitry, and function must be overcame. Notably, the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects of cell-cell communication networks play critical roles in homeostatic, driving the pathophysiologic and consequent cognitive outcomes. In the spinal cord, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia are involved in not only development but also pathology. Glial cells play dual roles (negative vs. positive effects) in these processes. After SCI, detrimental effects usually dominate and significantly retard functional recovery, and curbing these effects is critical for promoting neurological improvement. Indeed, residential innate immune cells (microglia and astrocytes) and infiltrating leukocytes (macrophages and neutrophils), activated by SCI, give rise to full-blown inflammatory cascades. These inflammatory cells release neurotoxins (proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, free radicals, excitotoxic amino acids, nitric oxide (NO)), all of which partake in axonal and neuronal deficit.Given the various multifaceted obstacles in SCI treatment, a combinatorial therapy of cell transplantation and biomaterial implantation may be addressed in detail here. For the sake of preserving damaged tissue integrity and providing physical support and trophic supply for axon regeneration, MSC transplantation has come to the front stage in therapy for SCI with the constant progress of stem cell engineering. MSC transplantation promotes scaffold integration and regenerative growth potential. Integrating into the implanted scaffold, MSCs influence implant integration by improving the healing process. Conversely, biomaterial scaffolds offer MSCs with a sheltered microenvironment from the surrounding pathological changes, in addition to bridging connection spinal cord stump and offering physical and directional support for axonal regeneration. Besides, Biomaterial scaffolds mimic the extracellular matrix to suppress immune responses.Here, we review the advances in combinatorial biomaterial scaffolds and MSC transplantation approach that targets certain aspects of various intercellular communications in the pathologic process following SCI. Finally, the challenges of biomaterial-supported MSC transplantation and its future direction for neuronal regeneration will be presented."
Corticospinal Motor Circuit Plasticity After Spinal Cord Injury: Harnessing Neuroplasticity to Improve Functional Outcomes,"Kazim SF, Bowers CA, Cole CD, Varela S, Karimov Z, Martinez E, Ogulnick JV, Schmidt MH.","AB  - As a part of the central nervous system, the spinal cord (SC) provides most of the communications between the brain and other parts of the body. Any damage to SC interrupts this communication, leading to serious problems, which may remain for the rest of their life. Due to its significant impact on patients' quality of life and its exorbitant medical costs, SC injury (SCI) is known as one of the most challengeable diseases in the world. Thus, it is critical to introduce highly translatable therapeutic platforms for SCI treatment. So far, different strategies have been introduced, among which utilizing various types of stem cells is one of the most interesting ones. The capability of stem cells to differentiate into several types of cell lines makes them promising candidates for the regeneration of injured tissues. One of the other interesting and novel strategies for SCI treatment is the application of nanomaterials, which could appear as a carrier for therapeutic agents or as a platform for culturing the cells. Combining these two approaches, stem cells and nanomaterials, could provide promising therapeutic strategies for SCI management. Accordingly, in this review we have summarized some of the recent advancements in which the applications of different types of stem cells and nanomaterials, alone and in combination forms, were evaluated for SCI treatment."
Stem cell-based cell therapy for spinal cord injury,"Kim BG, Hwang DH, Lee SI, Kim EJ, Kim SU.","AB  - Spinal cord injury is a chronic and debilitating neurological condition that is currently being managed symptomatically with no real therapeutic strategies available. Even though there is no consensus on the best time to start interventions, the chronic phase is definitely the most stable target in order to determine whether a therapy can effectively restore neurological function. The advancements of nanoscience and stem cell technology, combined with the powerful, novel neuroimaging modalities that have arisen can now accelerate the path of promising novel therapeutic strategies from bench to bedside. Several types of stem cells have reached up to clinical trials phase II, including adult neural stem cells, human spinal cord stem cells, olfactory ensheathing cells, autologous Schwann cells, umbilical cord blood-derived mononuclear cells, adult mesenchymal cells, and autologous bone-marrow-derived stem cells. There also have been combinations of different molecular therapies; these have been either alone or combined with supportive scaffolds with nanostructures to facilitate favorable cell⁻material interactions. The results already show promise but it will take some coordinated actions in order to develop a proper step-by-step approach to solve impactful problems with neural repair."
Optogenetics applications for treating spinal cord injury,"Ahmad A, Ashraf S, Komai S.","AB  - During competition a motocross athlete suffered a clinically complete spinal cord injury (SCI) at the Thoracic 11/12 levels according to MRIs (magnetic resonance imaging). Six weeks after the accident the subject began intensive Coordination Dynamics Therapy (CDT) at an up-to-date therapy centre. After 6 months of therapy, when further improvements were only marginal, the patient opted for haematopoietic stem cell therapy in addition to ongoing CDT. During two years of stem cell therapy, including 4 sessions of stem cell application, and ongoing coordination dynamics therapy, improvement remained marginal--no more than what would have been achieved with continuing only CDT. It is concluded that this haematopoietic stem cell therapy did not have any beneficial effect on the repair of the spinal cord in this patient. Differences in the regeneration capacity between commonly used laboratory animals and human are addressed. On the basis of a frog model for regeneration, cell communication, and neural control, it is discussed why complete SCI in human are difficult to improve and why for stem cell therapies more proper human knowledge is needed to induce structural repair and direct it to the injured sites of the neuronal networks. Further research is needed to improve and justify the clinical application of stem cell therapy. A thoughtful combination of stem cell therapy and CDT may have a chance of structural repair even in complete SCI. However, objective measures are needed to quantify improvement in MRI (anatomic measure), EMG (measuring of motor programs by sEMG, electrophysiologic measure), and measurements of coordination dynamics (kinesiologic measure)."
Direct neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells for spinal cord injury repair,"Xue W, Fan C, Chen B, Zhao Y, Xiao Z, Dai J.","AB  - Severe spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to almost complete neural cell loss at the injured site, causing the irreversible disruption of neuronal circuits. The transplantation of neural stem or precursor cells (NS/PCs) has been regarded as potentially effective for SCI treatment because NS/PCs can compensate for the injured sites by differentiating into neurons and glial cells (astrocytes and oligodendrocytes). An understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate the proliferation, fate specification and maturation of NS/PCs and their progeny would facilitate the establishment of better therapeutic strategies for regeneration after SCI. In recent years, several studies of SCI animal models have demonstrated that the modulation of specific epigenetic marks by histone modifiers and non-coding RNAs directs the setting of favorable cellular environments that promote the neuronal differentiation of NS/PCs and/or the elongation of the axons of the surviving neurons at the injured sites. In this review, we provide an overview of recent progress in the epigenetic regulation/manipulation of neural cells for the treatment of SCI."
Stem cell therapy for the spinal cord,"Donnelly EM, Lamanna J, Boulis NM.","AB  - Tissue engineering (TE) is a rapidly evolving biomedical discipline that can play an important role in treating neurogenic bladder dysfunction and compensating for current conventional options' shortcomings. This review aims to analyze the current status of preclinical and clinical trials and discuss what could be expected in the future based on the current state of the art. Although most preclinical studies provide promising results on the effectiveness of TE and stem cell therapies, the main limitations are mainly the very slow translation of preclinical trials to clinical trials, lack of quality research on neurogenic preconditions of neurogenic bladder dysfunction outside of the spinal cord injury and varying therapeutic methods of the existing research that lacks a standardized approach."
Transplanting neural progenitor cells to restore connectivity after spinal cord injury,"Fischer I, Dulin JN, Lane MA.","AB  - We investigated the effects of cytokines and chemokines and their associated signaling pathways on mesenchymal stem cell migration after spinal cord injury, to determine their roles in the curative effects of mesenchymal stem cells. This study reviewed the effects of tumor necrosis factor-α, vascular endothelial growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, insulin like growth factor-1, stromal cell-derived factor and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, 3 during mesenchymal stem cell migration to damaged sites, and analyzed the signal transduction pathways involved in their effects on mesenchymal stem cell migration. The results confirmed that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/serine/threonine protein kinases and nuclear factor-κB play crucial roles in the migration of mesenchymal stem cells induced by cytokines and chemokines."
Will stem cell therapies be safe and effective for treating spinal cord injuries?,"Thomas KE, Moon LD.","AB  - Stem cell therapies have significant potential to treat spinal cord injury (SCI), but it remains difficult to translate these therapies from 'bench to bedside'. Identifying barriers to translation and understanding how these barriers are viewed by stakeholders in the field of stem cell research are key steps to clinical translation. The Stem Cell Global Blueprint Conference, held in Toronto (ON, Canada) presented a unique opportunity to analyze the perspectives of multiple stakeholders on the future of stem cell therapies for SCI treatment. This article is an analysis of data collected at the conference, including a consensus-building process and pre- and in-conference questionnaires. The authors used these data to assess current perceptions of stem cell research and compared the findings with the literature. The authors identified the major barriers according to a wide range of stakeholders and what strategies they suggested to overcome these obstacles, with the aim of forwarding discussion on stem cell research. It is not a systematic review of the area, but rather a presentation of expert opinion with literature citations to give context and support to their arguments and suggestions. The authors believe that the international SCI community is ready for larger-scale clinical translation, which will require the continued cooperation of all stakeholders in the stem cell and SCI communities."
Glia in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal cord injury: common therapeutic targets,"Ban J, Sámano C, Mladinic M, Munitic I.","AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the recent studies about human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) and advances in the treatment of spinal cord injury. Data sources Published articles (1983 - 2007) about hUCMSCs and spinal cord injury were selected using Medline. Study selection Articles selected were relevant to development of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for transplantation in spinal cord injury therapy. Of 258 originally identified articles 51 were selected that specifically addressed the stated purpose. RESULTS: Recent work has revealed that hUCMSCs share most of the characteristics with MSCs derived from bone marrow and are more appropriate to transplantation for cell based therapies. CONCLUSIONS: Human umbilical cord could be regarded as a source of MSCs for experimental and clinical needs. In addition, as a peculiar source of stem cells, hUCMSCs may play an important role in the treatment of spinal cord injury."
Advancements in Spinal Cord Injury Repair: Insights from Dental-Derived Stem Cells,"Wen X, Jiang W, Li X, Liu Q, Kang Y, Song B.","AB  - Due to the complex pathophysiological mechanism, spinal cord injury (SCI) has become one of the most intractable central nervous system (CNS) diseases to therapy. Stem cell transplantation, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) particularly, appeals to more and more attention along with the encouraging therapeutic results for the functional regeneration of SCI. However, traditional cell transplantation strategies have some limitations, including the unsatisfying survival rate of MSCs and their random diffusion from the injection site to ambient tissues. The application of biomaterials in tissue engineering provides a new horizon. Biomaterials can not only confine MSCs in the injured lesions with higher cell viability, but also promote their therapeutic efficacy. This review summarizes the strategies and advantages of biomaterials reinforced MSCs transplantation to treat SCI in recent years, which are clarified in the light of various therapeutic effects in pathophysiological aspects of SCI."
Porcine Model of Spinal Cord Injury: A Systematic Review,"Weber-Levine C, Hersh AM, Jiang K, Routkevitch D, Tsehay Y, Perdomo-Pantoja A, Judy BF, Kerensky M, Liu A, Adams M, Izzi J, Doloff JC, Manbachi A, Theodore N.","AB  - Stem cells have been used in novel therapeutic strategies for spinal cord injury (SCI), but the effect of stem cell transplantation on neuropathic pain after SCI is unclear. The current meta-analysis evaluates the effects of stem cell transplantation on neuropathic pain after SCI. We first conducted online searches of PubMed, Web of Science, China Academic Journals Full-text Database, and Wanfang Data for randomized controlled trials that compared stem cell transplantation and vehicle treatments in rodent models of neuropathic pain after SCI. Quality assessment was performed using Cochrane Reviewer's Handbook 5.1.0, and meta-analysis was conducted with RevMan 5.3. Then, we developed a rat model of SCI and transplanted bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to verify meta-analysis results. Twelve randomized, controlled trials (n=354 total animals) were included in our meta-analysis and divided by subgroups, including species, timing of behavioral measurements, and transplantation time after SCI. Subgroup analysis of these 12 studies indicated that stem cell-treated animals had a higher mechanical reflex threshold than vehicle groups, with a significant difference in both rats and mice. The thermal withdrawal latency showed the same results in mouse subgroups, but not in rat subgroups. In addition, mesenchymal stem cell transplantation was an effective treatment for mechanical, but not thermal reflex hypersensitivity relief in rats. Transplantation showed a positive effect when carried out at 3 or 7days post-SCI. Stem cell transplantation alleviates mechanical reflex hypersensitivity in rats and mice and thermal reflex hypersensitivity in mice after SCI."
Transplantation Strategies for Spinal Cord Injury Based on Microenvironment Modulation,"Shu J, Cheng F, Gong Z, Ying L, Wang C, Yu C, Zhou X, Xiao M, Wang J, Xia K, Huang X, Tao Y, Shi K, Liu Y, Liang C, Chen Q, Feng X, Li F.","AB  - Injury and disease of the spinal cord are generally met with a poor prognosis. This poor prognosis is due not only to the characteristics of the diseases but also to our poor ability to deliver therapeutics to the spinal cord. The spinal cord is extremely sensitive to direct manipulation, and delivery of therapeutics has proven a challenge for both scientists and physicians. Recent advances in stem cell technologies have opened up a new avenue for the treatment of spinal cord disease and injury. Stem cells have proven beneficial in rodent models of spinal cord disease and injury. In these animal models, stem cells have been shown to produce their effect by the dual action of cell replacement and the trophic support of the factors secreted by these cells. In this review we look at the main clinical trials involving stem cell transplant into the spinal cord, focusing on motor neuron diseases and spinal cord injury. We will also discuss the major hurdles in optimizing stem cell delivery methods into the spinal cord. We shall examine current techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging guidance and cell labeling and will look at the current research striving to improve these techniques. With all caveats and future research taken into account, this is a very exciting time for stem cell transplant into the spinal cord. We are only beginning to realize the huge potential of stem cells in a central nervous system setting to provide cell replacement and trophic support. Many more trials will need to be undertaken before we can fully exploit the attributes of stem cells."
Dual differentiation-exogenous mesenchymal stem cell therapy for traumatic spinal cord injury repair in a murine hemisection model,"Liu H, Schwarz EM, Xie C.","AB  - Epidermal neural crest stem cell (EPI-NCSC) grafts cause a significant improvement in sensory connectivity and touch perception in the contused mouse spinal cord. EPI-NCSC are derived from the embryonic neural crest but reside in a postnatal location, the bulge of hair follicles. Both mouse and human EPI-NCSC are multipotent adult stem cells capable of generating all major neural crest derivatives. EPI-NCSC of mouse and human origin express the neural crest stem cell molecular signature, genes that were initially used to create induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, and other neural crest and global stem cell genes. Due to their origin in the neural folds and because they share a higher order stem cell, neural crest cells, and thus EPI-NCSC, are closely related to neural tube stem cells. This close ontological relationship with the spinal cord makes EPI-NCSC attractive candidates for cell-based therapy in spinal cord injury. In two different contusion models of spinal cord injury, we have shown that EPI-NCSC integrate into the murine spinal cord tissue and that subsets differentiate into GABAergic neurons and myelinating oligodendrocytes. Intraspinal EPI-NCSC do not form tumours. In the presence of EPI-NCSC grafts, but not in control animals, there is a 24% improvement of sensory connectivity and a substantial improvement in touch perception. Unilateral transplants leading to bilateral functional improvements suggest that underlying mechanisms include diffusible molecules. EPI-NCSC indeed express genes that encode neurotrophins, other trophic factors, angiogenic factors and metalloproteases. Intraspinal EPI-NCSC thus have multiple effects in the contused spinal cord, the sum of which can explain the observed functional improvements."
Human embryonic stem cell-derived oligodendrocyte progenitors for the treatment of spinal cord injury,"Faulkner J, Keirstead HS.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is induced by a variety of damages such as trauma, ischemia, and iatrogenic injury, resulting in sense and motion dysfunction. Despite the improvements in medical and surgical care, current treatment methods for SCI demonstrate poor and delayed efficiency, leading to different degree of permanent loss of neural function and disability in the patients. Rapid advances in stem-cells research suggest that stem cells may be applied in SCI therapy. Indeed, SCI is a major field in which stem-cell therapy has been proposed and practised, and most recently the clinical trials of stem-cell therapy were initiated, which aroused a number of clinical concerns. In this review, we summarize current status of SCI repair, then introduce the sources and biological characteristics of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and discuss the differentiation potential of iPSCs and the perspective of the application of iPSCs in SCI therapy."
Hydrogel scaffolds in the treatment of spinal cord injury: a review,"Cai M, Chen L, Wang T, Liang Y, Zhao J, Zhang X, Li Z, Wu H.","AB  - The toolkit for repairing damaged neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal cord injury (SCI) is extremely limited. Here, we reviewed the in vitro and in vivo studies and clinical trials on nonneuronal cells in the neurodegenerative processes common to both these conditions. Special focus was directed to microglia and astrocytes, because their activation and proliferation, also known as neuroinflammation, is a key driver of neurodegeneration. Neuroinflammation is a multifaceted process that evolves during the disease course, and can be either beneficial or toxic to neurons. Given the fundamental regulatory functions of glia, pathogenic mechanisms in neuroinflammation represent promising therapeutic targets. We also discussed neuroprotective, immunosuppressive, and stem-cell based approaches applicable to both ALS and SCI."
Olfactory Ensheathing Cells for Spinal Cord Injury: Sniffing Out the Issues,"Yao R, Murtaza M, Velasquez JT, Todorovic M, Rayfield A, Ekberg J, Barton M, St John J.","AB  - Spinal cord injury remains a scientific and therapeutic challenge with great cost to individuals and society. The goal of research in this field is to find a means of restoring lost function. Recently we have seen considerable progress in understanding the injury process and the capacity of CNS neurons to regenerate, as well as innovations in stem cell biology. This presents an opportunity to develop effective transplantation strategies to provide new neural cells to promote the formation of new neuronal networks and functional connectivity. Past and ongoing clinical studies have demonstrated the safety of cell therapy, and preclinical research has used models of spinal cord injury to better elucidate the underlying mechanisms through which donor cells interact with the host and thus increase long-term efficacy. While a variety of cell therapies have been explored, we focus here on the use of neural progenitor cells obtained or derived from different sources to promote connectivity in sensory, motor and autonomic systems."
A Bayesian Network Analysis of the Efficacy of Scaffolds and Stem Cells in Spinal Cord Injury Treatment,"Wang Y, Yi H.","AB  - Traumatic injuries to the spinal cord lead to severe and permanent neurological deficits. Although no effective therapeutic option is currently available, recent animal studies have shown that cellular transplantation strategies hold promise to enhance functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI). This review is to analyze the experiments where transplantation of stem/progenitor cells produced successful functional outcome in animal models of SCI. There is no consensus yet on what kind of stem/progenitor cells is an ideal source for cellular grafts. Three kinds of stem/progenitor cells have been utilized in cell therapy in animal models of SCI: embryonic stem cells, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, and neural stem cells. Neural stem cells or fate-restricted neuronal or glial progenitor cells were preferably used because they have clear capacity to become neurons or glial cells after transplantation into the injured spinal cord. At least a part of functional deficits after SCI is attributable to chronic progressive demyelination. Therefore, several studies transplanted glial-restricted progenitors or oligodendrocyte precursors to target the demyelination process. Directed differentiation of stem/progenitor cells to oligodendrocyte lineage prior to transplantation or modulation of microenvironment in the injured spinal cord to promote oligodendroglial differentiation seems to be an effective strategy to increase the extent of remyelination. Transplanted stem/progenitor cells can also contribute to promoting axonal regeneration by functioning as cellular scaffolds for growing axons. Combinatorial approaches using polymer scaffolds to fill the lesion cavity or introducing regeneration-promoting genes will greatly increase the efficacy of cellular transplantation strategies for SCI."
Role and prospects of regenerative biomaterials in the repair of spinal cord injury,"Liu S, Xie YY, Wang B.","AB  - BACKGROND: Novel scaffolds and stem cells are alternatives for the treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI), which causes life-long disability. However, there is a lack of synthesized evidence comparing different therapies. AIM: To examine the efficacy of various treatments in achieving locomotor recovery in SCI animals. The PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to 21st May 2021. METHODS: The data were extracted by one investigator under the surveillance of a referee according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 statement and stored in Microsoft Excel. All data were analysed using Bayesian network analysis with a consistency model. The selection was performed in strict accordance with the participant, intervention, comparison, outcome and study (PICOS) principle, as specifically stated in the methods section. RESULTS: A total of 387 eligible studies involving 11169 animals subjected to 5 different treatments were evaluated. Compared to placebo or no treatment, scaffolds (mean difference (MD), 2.04; 95% credible interval (CrI): 1.58 to 2.50), exosomes (MD, 3.46; 95% CrI: 3.07 to 3.86), stem cells (MD, 4.18; 95% CrI: 3.28 to 5.07), scaffolds in conjunction with stem cells (MD, 5.26; 95% CrI: 4.62 to 5.89), and scaffolds in conjunction with non-cell agents (MD, 4.88; 95% CrI: 4.21 to 5.54) led to significant recovery of locomotor function in SCI animals. No significant difference in the locomotor function score was observed between animals treated with stem cells and those treated with exosomes (MD, 0.71; 95% CrI: -0.25 to 3.05), between animals treated with scaffolds in conjunction with stem cells and those treated with scaffolds in conjunction with non-cell agents (MD, -0.38; 95% CrI: -1.24 to 0.49), or between animals treated with scaffolds in conjunction with non-cell agents and those treated with stem cells (MD, 0.71; 95% CrI: - 0.38 to 1.80). CONCLUSION: Significant differences in the efficacy of various therapies in SCI animals were observed, and transplantation of scaffolds in conjunction with non-cell agents, scaffolds in conjunction with stem cells, and stem cells should be considered over transplantation of exosomes or scaffolds alone. Even though transplantation of scaffolds alone promoted locomotor function recovery in SCI animals, its use should be discouraged."
Repair of spinal cord injury by bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis based on rat models,"Ye Z, Zheng Y, Li N, Zhang H, Li Q, Wang X.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition that affects approximately 294,000 people in the USA and several millions worldwide. The corticospinal motor circuitry plays a major role in controlling skilled movements and in planning and coordinating movements in mammals and can be damaged by SCI. While axonal regeneration of injured fibers over long distances is scarce in the adult CNS, substantial spontaneous neural reorganization and plasticity in the spared corticospinal motor circuitry has been shown in experimental SCI models, associated with functional recovery. Beneficially harnessing this neuroplasticity of the corticospinal motor circuitry represents a highly promising therapeutic approach for improving locomotor outcomes after SCI. Several different strategies have been used to date for this purpose including neuromodulation (spinal cord/brain stimulation strategies and brain-machine interfaces), rehabilitative training (targeting activity-dependent plasticity), stem cells and biological scaffolds, neuroregenerative/neuroprotective pharmacotherapies, and light-based therapies like photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photobiomodulation (PMBT). This review provides an overview of the spontaneous reorganization and neuroplasticity in the corticospinal motor circuitry after SCI and summarizes the various therapeutic approaches used to beneficially harness this neuroplasticity for functional recovery after SCI in preclinical animal model and clinical human patients' studies."
Efficacy and safety of bone marrow-derived cell transplantation for spinal cord injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials,"Li XC, Zhong CF, Deng GB, Liang RW, Huang CM.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is different from peripheral nerve injury; it results in devastating and permanent damage to the spine, leading to severe motor, sensory and autonomic dysfunction. SCI produces a complex microenvironment that can result in hemorrhage, inflammation and scar formation. Not only does it significantly limit regeneration, but it also challenges a multitude of transplantation strategies. In order to promote regeneration, researchers have recently begun to focus their attention on strategies that manipulate the complicated microenvironment produced by SCI. And some have achieved great therapeutic effects. Hence, reconstructing an appropriate microenvironment after transplantation could be a potential therapeutic solution for SCI. In this review, first, we aim to summarize the influential compositions of the microenvironment and their different effects on regeneration. Second, we highlight recent research that used various transplantation strategies to modulate different microenvironments produced by SCI in order to improve regeneration. Finally, we discuss future transplantation strategies regarding SCI."
Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling in Neural Stem Cell Homeostasis and Neurological Diseases,"Gao J, Liao Y, Qiu M, Shen W.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a disease of the central nervous system often caused by accidents, and its prognosis is unsatisfactory, with long-term adverse effects on patients' lives. The key to its treatment lies in the improvement of the microenvironment at the injury and the reconstruction of axons, and tissue repair is a promising therapeutic strategy. Hydrogel is a three-dimensional mesh structure with high water content, which has the advantages of biocompatibility, degradability, and adjustability, and can be used to fill pathological defects by injectable flowing hydrophilic material in situ to accurately adapt to the size and shape of the injury. Hydrogels mimic the natural extracellular matrix for cell colonization, guide axon extension, and act as a biological scaffold, which can be used as an excellent carrier to participate in the treatment of SCI. The addition of different materials to make composite hydrogel scaffolds can further enhance their performance in all aspects. In this paper, we introduce several typical composite hydrogels and review the research progress of hydrogel for SCI to provide a reference for the clinical application of hydrogel therapy for SCI."
"Extracellular Vesicles in the Pathogenesis, Treatment, and Diagnosis of Spinal Cord Injury: A Mini-Review","Wang Y, Xu H, Wang J, Yi H, Song Y.","AB  - Spinal cord injury usually leads to permanent disability, which could cause a huge financial problem to the patient. Up to now there is no effective method to treat this disease. The key of the treatment is to enable the damage zone axonal regeneration and luckily it could go through the damage zone; last a connection can be established with the target neurons. This study attempts to combine stem cell, material science and genetic modification technology together, by preparing two genes modified adipose-derived stem cells and inducing them into neuron direction; then by compositing them on the silk fibroin/chitosan scaffold and implanting them into the spinal cord injury model, seed cells can have features of neuron cells. At the same time, it could stably express the brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-3, both of which could produce synergistic effects, which have a positive effect on the recovery of spinal cord. The spinal cord scaffold bridges the broken end of the spinal cord and isolates with the surrounding environment, which could avoid a scar effect on the nerve regeneration and provide three-dimensional space for the seed cell growth, and at last we hope to provide a new treatment for spinal cord injury with the tissue engineering technique."
Recent advances in managing a spinal cord injury secondary to trauma,"Ahuja CS, Martin AR, Fehlings M.","AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinal cord injury (SCI) affects around 18,000 individuals annually, representing nearly one-third of all paralysis cases.

The evolution of nerve transfers for spinal cord injury,"Bazarek S, Brown JM.","AB  - Spinal cord injury devastates the CNS, besetting patients with symptoms including but not limited to: paralysis, autonomic nervous dysfunction, pain disorders and depression. Despite the identification of several molecular and genetic factors, a reliable regenerative therapy has yet to be produced for this terminal disease. Perhaps the missing piece of this puzzle will be discovered within endogenous electrotactic cellular behaviors. Neurons and stem cells both show mediated responses (growth rate, migration, differentiation) to electromagnetic waves, including direct current electric fields. This review analyzes the pathophysiology of spinal cord injury, the rationale for regenerative cell therapy and the evidence for directing cell therapy via electromagnetic waves shown by in vitro experiments."
Cell transplantation for spinal cord injury focusing on iPSCs,"Nakamura M, Tsuji O, Nori S, Toyama Y, Okano H.","AB  - Stem cells are self-renewing, pluripotent cells that can be manipulated in vitro to differentiate into virtually any cell type. Stem cells are highly proliferative and have the potential to expand into very large numbers of a desired cell lineage. As such, they represent an excellent source of cells for cellular replacement strategies in disease states that are typified by a loss of a particular cell population. Recent studies have indicated that spinal cord injury is accompanied by chronic progressive demyelination, and have thus identified oligodendrocytes as a desirable transplant population for remyelination strategies. To address this need, we developed a method to differentiate hESCs into high purity human oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Transplantation into spinal cord injury sites in adult rats resulted in remyelination and functional repair. Here, we summarize these findings and present new data concerning the effects of hESC-derived OPC transplantation on the host environment."

Mechanism Underlying Acupuncture Therapy in Spinal Cord Injury: A Narrative Overview of Preclinical Studies,"Jiang K, Sun Y, Chen X.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) remains an important public health problem which often causes permanent loss of muscle strength, sensation, and function below the site of the injury, generating physical, psychological, and social impacts throughout the lives of the affected individuals, since there are no effective treatments available. The use of stem cells has been investigated as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of SCI. Although a significant number of studies have been conducted in pre-clinical and clinical settings, so far there is no established cell therapy for the treatment of SCI. One aspect that makes it difficult to evaluate the efficacy is the heterogeneity of experimental designs in the clinical trials that have been published. Cell transplantation methods vary widely among the trials, and there are still no standardized protocols or recommendations for the therapeutic use of stem cells in SCI. Among the different cell types, mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are the most frequently tested in clinical trials for SCI treatment. This study reviews the clinical applications of MSCs for SCI, focusing on the critical analysis of 17 clinical trials published thus far, with emphasis on their design and quality. Moreover, it highlights the need for more evidence-based studies designed as randomized controlled trials and potential challenges to be addressed in context of stem cell therapies for SCI."
Exosomes combined with biomaterials in the treatment of spinal cord injury,"Zhang X, Jiang W, Lu Y, Mao T, Gu Y, Ju D, Dong C.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in permanent neurological dysfunction and neuropathic pain. To address this pathology, we recently conducted a clinical study in which we transplanted neural precursor cells (NPCs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells into patients during the subacute phase of SCI. One of the therapeutic mechanisms of cell transplantation is the formation of synaptic connections with the host's neural tissues, which we demonstrated using a chemogenetic tool. In addition, we have developed innovative strategies to enhance the effectiveness of cell transplantation through gene therapy. Moreover, our current study is focused on developing cell therapy for chronic SCI, a more challenging pathology characterized by the formation of cavities and scar tissue. In such situations, transplanting NPCs with neurogenic properties could effectively penetrate scar tissue and form functional synapses with the host neurons. To improve the outcomes of cell transplantation alone, we have found that incorporating rehabilitation is beneficial. In animal models of SCI, we have established an effective rehabilitative training program in which NPCs were transplanted during the chronic phase. Robotic rehabilitation has demonstrated improvements in gait ability and trunk function in clinical situations. Therefore, regenerative medicine shows promise for chronic SCI, particularly when rehabilitation strategies are incorporated."
Therapeutical Strategies for Spinal Cord Injury and a Promising Autologous Astrocyte-Based Therapy Using Efficient Reprogramming Techniques,"Yang H, Liu CC, Wang CY, Zhang Q, An J, Zhang L, Hao DJ.","AB  - Stem cell transplantation has been applied to treat spinal cord injury (SCI) in clinical trials for many years. However, the clinical efficacies of stem cell transplantation in SCI have been quite diverse. The purpose of our study was to systematically investigate the efficacy of stem cell transplantation in patients with SCI. The PubMed, Web of Science, Ovid-Medline, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP, Wanfang, and SinoMed databases were searched until October 27, 2020. Quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed by Review Manager 5.3 and R. Nine studies (n = 328) were included, and the overall risk of bias was moderate. The ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) grading improvement rate was analyzed in favor of stem cell transplantation group [odds ratio (OR) = 6.06, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.16-11.62, P < 0.00001]. Urodynamic indices also showed improvement in bladder function. In subgroup analyses, the results indicated that in patients with complete (AIS A) SCI, with the application of cell numbers between n*(10(7)-10(8)), two cell types (i.e., bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and bone marrow mononuclears), and treatment time of more than 6 months, stem cell transplantation was more beneficial for sensorimotor function (P < 0.05 for all groups). The risk of fever incidence in the stem cell transplantation group was 4.22 (95% CI: 1.7-10.22, P = 0.001), and principal component analysis (PCA) suggested it was more related to transplanted cell numbers. Thus, stem cell transplantation can promote functional recovery in SCI patients. Moreover, the type and quantity of transplanted stem cells and treatment time are important factors affecting the therapeutic effect of stem cell transplantation in SCI. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effects and elucidate the mechanisms of these factors on stem cell therapy in SCI."
Regenerative treatment in spinal cord injury,"Ozdemir M, Attar A, Kuzu I.","AB  - Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) are glia reported to sustain the continuous axon extension and successful topographic targeting of the olfactory receptor neurons responsible for the sense of smell (olfaction). Due to this distinctive property, OECs have been trialed in human cell transplant therapies to assist in the repair of central nervous system injuries, particularly those of the spinal cord. Though many studies have reported neurological improvement, the therapy remains inconsistent and requires further improvement. Much of this variability stems from differing olfactory cell populations prior to transplantation into the injury site. While some studies have used purified cells, others have used unpurified transplants. Although both preparations have merits and faults, the latter increases the variability between transplants received by recipients. Without a robust purification procedure in OEC transplantation therapies, the full potential of OECs for spinal cord injury may not be realised."
Neural stem cells in the adult spinal cord,"Sabelström H, Stenudd M, Frisén J.","AB  - This review summarizes current progress on development of astrocyte transplantation therapies for repair of the damaged central nervous system. Replacement of neurons in the injured or diseased central nervous system is currently one of the most popular therapeutic goals, but if neuronal replacement is attempted in the absence of appropriate supporting cells (astrocytes and oligodendrocytes), then the chances of restoring neurological functional are greatly reduced. Although the past 20 years have offered great progress on oligodendrocyte replacement therapies, astrocyte transplantation therapies have been both less explored and comparatively less successful. We have now developed successful astrocyte transplantation therapies by pre-differentiating glial restricted precursor (GRP) cells into a specific population of GRP cell-derived astrocytes (GDAs) by exposing the GRP cells to bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP) prior to transplantation. When transplanted into transected rat spinal cord, rat and human GDAs(BMP) promote extensive axonal regeneration, rescue neuronal cell survival, realign tissue structure, and restore behavior to pre-injury levels on a grid-walk analysis of volitional foot placement. Such benefits are not provided by GRP cells themselves, demonstrating that the lesion environment does not direct differentiation in a manner optimally beneficial for the restoration of function. Such benefits also are not provided by transplantation of a different population of astrocytes generated from GRP cells exposed to ciliary neurotrophic factor (GDAs(CNTF)), thus providing the first transplantation-based evidence of functional heterogeneity in astrocyte populations. Moreover, lessons learned from the study of rat cells are strongly predictive of outcomes using human cells. Thus, these studies provide successful strategies for the use of astrocyte transplantation therapies for restoration of function following spinal cord injury."
Spinal cord astrocytomas: progresses in experimental and clinical investigations for developing recovery neurobiology-based novel therapies,"Teng YD, Abd-El-Barr M, Wang L, Hajiali H, Wu L, Zafonte RD.","AB  - Axonal junction defects and an inhibitory environment after spinal cord injury seriously hinder the regeneration of damaged tissues and neuronal functions. At the site of spinal cord injury, regenerative biomaterials can fill cavities, deliver curative drugs, and provide adsorption sites for transplanted or host cells. Some regenerative biomaterials can also inhibit apoptosis, inflammation and glial scar formation, or further promote neurogenesis, axonal growth and angiogenesis. This review summarized a variety of biomaterial scaffolds made of natural, synthetic, and combined materials applied to spinal cord injury repair. Although these biomaterial scaffolds have shown a certain therapeutic effect in spinal cord injury repair, there are still many problems to be resolved, such as product standards and material safety and effectiveness."
Subacute traumatic spinal cord injury: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of therapeutic strategies based on bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells in animal models,"Shang Z, Wang M, Zhang B, Wang X, Wanyan P.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) typically results in long-lasting functional deficits, largely due to primary and secondary white matter damage at the site of injury. The transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) has shown promise for re-establishing communications between separated regions of the spinal cord through the insertion of new neurons between the injured axons and target neurons. However, the inhibitory microenvironment that develops after SCI often causes endogenous and transplanted NSCs to differentiate into glial cells rather than neurons. Functional biomaterials have been shown to mitigate the effects of the adverse SCI microenvironment and promote the neuronal differentiation of NSCs. A clear understanding of the mechanisms of neuronal differentiation within the injury-induced microenvironment would likely allow for the development of treatment strategies designed to promote the innate ability of NSCs to differentiate into neurons. The increased differentiation of neurons may contribute to relay formation, facilitating functional recovery after SCI. In this review, we summarize current strategies used to enhance the neuronal differentiation of NSCs through the reconstruction of the SCI microenvironment and to improve the intrinsic neuronal differentiation abilities of NSCs, which is significant for SCI repair."
MiRNAs as Promising Translational Strategies for Neuronal Repair and Regeneration in Spinal Cord Injury,"Silvestro S, Mazzon E.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is the most common disabling spinal injury, a complex pathologic process that can eventually lead to severe neurological dysfunction. The Wnt/mTOR signaling pathway is a pervasive signaling cascade that regulates a wide range of physiological processes during embryonic development, from stem cell pluripotency to cell fate. Numerous studies have reported that Wnt/mTOR signaling pathway plays an important role in neural development, synaptogenesis, neuron growth, differentiation and survival after the central nervous system (CNS) is damaged. Wnt/mTOR also plays an important role in regulating various pathophysiological processes after spinal cord injury (SCI). After SCI, Wnt/mTOR signal regulates the physiological and pathological processes of neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation, neuronal axon regeneration, neuroinflammation and pain through multiple pathways. Due to the characteristics of the Wnt signal in SCI make it a potential therapeutic target of SCI. In this paper, the characteristics of Wnt/mTOR signal, the role of Wnt/mTOR pathway on SCI and related mechanisms are reviewed, and some unsolved problems are discussed. It is hoped to provide reference value for the research field of the role of Wnt/mTOR pathway in SCI, and provide a theoretical basis for biological therapy of SCI."
Disease-specific interventions using cell therapies for spinal cord disease/injury,"Zipser CM, Curt A.","AB  - INTRODUCTION: Reports of functional recovery from spinal cord injury (SCI) after the transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) derived from fetus/embryonic stem cells (ESCs), has raised great expectations for the successful clinical use of stem cell transplantation therapy. However, the ethical issues involved in destroying human embryos or fertilized oocytes to obtain NSCs have been a major obstacle to developing clinically useful stem cell sources, and the transplantation of stem cells isolated from other human embryonic tissues has not yet been developed for use in clinical applications. AREAS COVERED: Recently, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which can serve as a source of cells for autologous transplantation, have been attracting a great deal of attention as a clinically viable alternative to stem cells obtained directly from tissues. In this review, the authors outline the neural induction of ESC/iPSC, their therapeutic efficacy in SCI and their safety in vivo. EXPERT OPINION: Although iPSCs offer great promise as the cell source for autologous transplantation for SCI, safety issues including tumorigenicity should be determined prior to the clinical trial."

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in traumatic spinal cord injury,"Aschauer-Wallner S, Leis S, Bogdahn U, Johannesen S, Couillard-Despres S, Aigner L.","AB  - Cases of spinal cord injury (SCI) are increasing all over the world; and in USA alone, there are 273,000 patients, which not only leads to morbidity and mortality but also results in a great economic burden. Many approaches are being used at the pre-clinical and clinical level to treat SCI including therapeutic agents, surgical decompression, stem cell therapy etc. Recently, a new approach called optogenetics has emerged in which light sensitive proteins are used to switch neurons on and off, and this approach has great potential to be used as therapy due to its specificity and rapid response in milliseconds. Few animal studies have been performed so far in which the respiratory and bladder function of rats was restored through the use of optogenetics. On the basis of promising results obtained, in the future, this approach can prove to be a valuable tool to treat patients with SCI."
Stem cell-based therapy for systemic sclerosis,"Zare Moghaddam M, Mousavi MJ, Ghotloo S.","AB  - Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation has shown tremendous promise as a therapy for repair of various tissues of the musculoskeletal, vascular, and central nervous systems. Based on this success, recent research in this field has focused on complex tissue damage, such as that which occurs from traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI). As the critical event for successful exogenous, MSC therapy is their migration to the injury site, which allows for their anti-inflammatory and morphogenic effects on fracture healing, neuronal regeneration, and functional recover. Thus, there is a need for a cost-effective in vivo model that can faithfully recapitulate the salient features of the injury, therapy, and recovery. To address this, we review the recent advances in exogenous MSC therapy for TSCI and traumatic vertebral fracture repair and the existing challenges regarding their translational applications. We also describe a novel murine model designed to take advantage of multidisciplinary collaborations between musculoskeletal and neuroscience researchers, which is needed to establish an efficacious MSC therapy for TSCI."
The regenerative effects of electromagnetic field on spinal cord injury,"Ross CL, Syed I, Smith TL, Harrison BS.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a serious and disabling disease with a high mortality rate. It often leads to complete or partial sensory and motor dysfunction and is accompanied by a series of secondary outcomes, such as pressure sores, pulmonary infections, deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremities, urinary tract infections, and autonomic dysfunction. Currently, the main treatments for SCI include surgical decompression, drug therapy, and postoperative rehabilitation. Studies have shown that cell therapy plays a beneficial role in the treatment of SCI. Nonetheless, there is controversy regarding the therapeutic effect of cell transplantation in SCI models. Meanwhile exosomes, as a new therapeutic medium for regenerative medicine, possess the advantages of small size, low immunogenicity, and the ability to cross the blood-spinal cord barrier. Certain studies have shown that stem cell-derived exosomes have anti-inflammatory effects and can play an irreplaceable role in the treatment of SCI. In this case, it is difficult for a single treatment method to play an effective role in the repair of neural tissue after SCI. The combination of biomaterial scaffolds and exosomes can better transfer and fix exosomes to the injury site and improve their survival rate. This paper first reviews the current research status of stem cell-derived exosomes and biomaterial scaffolds in the treatment of SCI respectively, and then describes the application of exosomes combined with biomaterial scaffolds in the treatment of SCI, as well as the challenges and prospects."
Extrinsic and Intrinsic Regulation of Axon Regeneration by MicroRNAs after Spinal Cord Injury,"Li P, Teng ZQ, Liu CM.","AB  - INTRODUCTION: A large number of different cells including embryonic and adult stem cells have been transplanted into animal models of spinal cord injury, and in many cases these procedures have resulted in modest sensorimotor benefits. In October 2010 the world's first clinical trial using human embryonic stem cells began, using stem cells converted into oligodendrocyte precursor cells. SOURCES OF DATA: In this review we examine some of the publically available preclinical evidence that some of these cell types improve outcome in animal models of spinal cord injury. Much evidence is not available for public scrutiny, however, being private commercial property of various stem cell companies. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: Transplantation of many different types of stem and progenitor cell enhances spontaneous recovery of function when transplanted acutely after spinal cord injury in animal models. AREAS OF DISAGREEMENT: The common mechanism(s) whereby the generic procedure of cellular transplantation enhances recovery of function are not well understood, although a range of possibilities are usually cited (including preservation of tissue, remyelination, axon sprouting, glial cell replacement). Only in exceptional cases has it been shown that functional recovery depends causally on the survival and differentiation of the transplanted cells. There is no agreement about the optimal cell type for transplantation: candidate stem cells have not yet been compared with each other or with other cell types (e.g. autologous Schwann cells) in a single study. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: Transplantation of cells into animals with a long lifespan is important to determine whether or not tumours will eventually form. It will also be important to determine whether long-term survival of cells is required for functional recovery, and if so, how many are optimal."
Stem cell therapy in bladder dysfunction: where are we? And where do we have to go?,"Kim JH, Lee SR, Song YS, Lee HJ.","AB  - Spinal cord injury is a devastating, traumatic event, and experienced mainly among young people. Until the modern era, spinal cord injury was so rapidly fatal that no seriously injured persons would survive long enough for regeneration to occur. Treatment of spinal cord injury can be summarized as follows: prevent further cord injury, maintain blood flow, relieve spinal cord compression, and provide secure vertebral stabilization so as to allow mobilization and rehabilitation, none of which achieves functional recovery. Previous studies have focused on analyzing the pathogenesis of secondary injury that extends from the injury epicenter to the periphery, as well as the tissue damage and neural cell death associated with secondary injury. Now, there are hundreds of current experimental and clinical regenerative treatment studies. One of the most popular treatment method is cell transplantation in injured spinal cord. For this purpose bone marrow stromal cells, mononuclear stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, embryonic stem cells, neural stem cells, and olfactory ensheathing cells can be used. As a result, cell transplantation has become a promising therapeutic option for spinal cord injury patients. In this paper we discuss the effectiveness of stem cell therapy in spinal cord injury."
Systematic review of induced pluripotent stem cell technology as a potential clinical therapy for spinal cord injury,"Kramer AS, Harvey AR, Plant GW, Hodgetts SI.","AB  - Neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs) maintain the ability of self-renewal and differentiation and compose the complex nervous system. Wnt signaling is thought to control the balance of NSC proliferation and differentiation via the transcriptional coactivator β-catenin during brain development and adult tissue homeostasis. Disruption of Wnt signaling may result in developmental defects and neurological diseases. Here, we summarize recent findings of the roles of Wnt/β-catenin signaling components in NSC homeostasis for the regulation of functional brain circuits. We also suggest that the potential role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling might lead to new therapeutic strategies for neurological diseases, including, but not limited to, spinal cord injury, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and depression."
Progress of mesenchymal stem cell therapy for neural and retinal diseases,"Ng TK, Fortino VR, Pelaez D, Cheung HS.","AB  - Spinal cord astrocytomas (SCAs) have discernibly unique signatures in regards to epidemiology, clinical oncological features, genetic markers, pathophysiology, and research and therapeutic challenges. Overall, there are presently very limited clinical management options for high grade SCAs despite progresses made in validating key molecular markers and standardizing tumor classification. The endeavors were aimed to improve diagnosis, therapy design and prognosis assessment, as well as to define more effective oncolytic targets. Efficacious treatment for high grade SCAs still remains an unmet medical demand. This review is therefore focused on research state updates that have been made upon analyzing clinical characteristics, diagnostic classification, genetic and molecular features, tumor initiation cell biology, and current management options for SCAs. Particular emphasis was given to basic and translational research endeavors targeting SCAs, including establishment of experimental models, exploration of unique profiles of SCA stem cell-like tumor survival cells, characterization of special requirements for effective therapeutic delivery into the spinal cord, and development of donor stem cell-based gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy. We concluded that precise understanding of molecular oncology, tumor survival mechanisms (e.g., drug resistance, metastasis, and cancer stem cells/tumor survival cells), and principles of Recovery Neurobiology can help to create clinically meaningful experimental models of SCAs. Establishment of such systems will expedite the discovery of efficacious therapies that not only kill tumor cells but simultaneously preserve and improve residual neural function."
The Role of Therapeutic Hypothermia After Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury--A Systematic Review,"Alkabie S, Boileau AJ.","AB  - Autoimmune diseases, including SSc, are prevalent, affecting autologous connective tissues and caused by the breakdown of self-tolerance mechanisms of the immune system. During the last 2 decades, stem cell therapy has been increasingly considered as a therapeutic option in various diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, liver disease, diabetes, heart disease, bone disease, renal disease, respiratory disease and haematological abnormalities such as anaemia. This is due to the unique properties of stem cells that both divide and differentiate to the specialized cells in the damaged tissue. Moreover, they impose immunomodulatory properties affecting the diseases caused by immunological abnormalities such as SSc. In the present review, the efficacy of stem cell therapy with two main types of stem cells, including mesenchymal stem cells and hematopoietic stem cells, will be reviewed. Moreover, other related issues, including safety, changes in immunological parameters, suitable choice of stem cell origin, conditioning regimen and complications of stem cell treatment will be discussed."

Application of fibrin-based hydrogels for nerve protection and regeneration after spinal cord injury,"Yu Z, Li H, Xia P, Kong W, Chang Y, Fu C, Wang K, Yang X, Qi Z.","AB  - PURPOSE: Bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) for clinical transplantation were carried out many years in treating spinal cord injury (SCI) without a clear conclusion. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BMDC transplantation in treatment of SCI patients. METHOD: Electronic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane library, were searched to identify clinical therapeutic trials studying the application of BMDC transplantation in SCI. RESULTS: Overall the quality of the 24 studies was low, including one Grade I level of evidence, six Grade II levels, three Grade III levels, and 14 Grade IV levels. With a maximum of six-yr follow-up, the procedure-related complications were minor and temporary, without serious adverse events (p = 0, n = 594). AIS improvement rate was analyzed in favor of BMDCs 6.13 (95% CI, 3.0-12.51; p < 0.001). In patient with complete (AIS A) and chronic SCI, the application of cell transplantation numbers between n × (10(7) -10(8) ) seemed to be more beneficial (p < 0.05 for all groups). CONCLUSIONS: Based on short-medium terms following up, BMDC transplantation appears to be safe and valid in SCI patients, more effective in chronic and complete injury. Nonetheless, prospective, randomized trials in larger cohorts are still needed."
Regenerative replacement of neural cells for treatment of spinal cord injury,"McIntyre WB, Pieczonka K, Khazaei M, Fehlings MG.","AB  - Traumatic spinal cord injuries (SCIs) affect 1.3 million North Americans, producing devastating physical, social, and vocational impairment. Pathophysiologically, the initial mechanical trauma is followed by a significant secondary injury which includes local ischemia, pro-apoptotic signaling, release of cytotoxic factors, and inflammatory cell infiltration.

Potential role of stem cells in severe spinal cord injury: current perspectives and clinical data,"Paspala SA, Vishwakarma SK, Murthy TV, Rao TN, Khan AA.","AB  - Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a cytokine used in pharmaceutical preparations for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Evidence from experimental studies indicates that G-CSF exerts relevant activities in the central nervous system (CNS) in particular after lesions. In acute, subacute, and chronic CNS lesions, G-CSF appears to have strong anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, antioxidative, myelin-protective, and axon-regenerative activities. Additional effects result in the stimulation of angiogenesis and neurogenesis as well as in bone marrow stem cell mobilization to the CNS. There are emerging preclinical and clinical data indicating that G-CSF is a safe and effective drug for the treatment of acute and chronic traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI), which we summarize in this review."
Repair of spinal cord injury with neuronal relays: From fetal grafts to neural stem cells,"Bonner JF, Steward O.","AB  - BACKGROUND: Benefiting from in-depth research into stem cells, extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are byproducts of cells and membrane-wrapped microvesicles (30-120 nm) containing lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, may cast light on the research and development of therapeutics capable of improving the neurological recovery of spinal cord injury (SCI) animals. However, the mechanistic modes of action for EVs in alleviating the lesion size of SCI remain to be solved, thus presenting a tremendous gap existing in translation from the laboratory to the clinic. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this minireview was to cover a wide range of basic views on EVs involved in SCI treatment, including the effects of EVs on the pathogenesis, treatment, and diagnosis of spinal cord injury. METHODS: We searched databases (i.e., PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Medline, and EMBASE) and acquired all accessible articles published in the English language within five years. Studies reporting laboratory applications of EVs in the treatment of SCI were included and screened to include studies presenting relevant molecular mechanisms. RESULTS: This review first summarized the basic role of EVs in cell communication, cell death, inflammatory cascades, scar formation, neuronal regrowth, and angiogenesis after SCI, thereby providing insights into neuroprotection and consolidated theories for future clinical application of EVs. CONCLUSION: EVs participate in an extremely wide range of cell activities, play a critical role in cell communication centring neurons, and are considered potential therapies and biomarkers for SCI. miRNAs are the most abundant nucleic acids shipped by EVs and effluent cytokines, and they may represent important messengers of EVs and important factors in SCI treatment."
Neuroinflammation and Scarring After Spinal Cord Injury: Therapeutic Roles of MSCs on Inflammation and Glial Scar,"Pang QM, Chen SY, Xu QJ, Fu SP, Yang YC, Zou WH, Zhang M, Liu J, Wan WH, Peng JC, Zhang T.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating disease with limited effective treatment options. Animal paradigms are vital for understanding the pathogenesis of SCI and testing potential therapeutics. The porcine model of SCI is increasingly favored because of its greater similarity to humans. However, its adoption is limited by the complexities of care and range of testing parameters. Researchers need to consider swine selection, injury method, post-operative care, rehabilitation, behavioral outcomes, and histology metrics. Therefore, we systematically reviewed full-text English-language articles to evaluate study characteristics used in developing a porcine model and summarize the interventions that have been tested using this paradigm. A total of 63 studies were included, with 33 examining SCI pathogenesis and 30 testing interventions. Studies had an average sample size of 15 pigs with an average weight of 26 kg, and most used female swine with injury to the thoracic cord. Injury was most commonly induced by weight drop with compression. The porcine model is amenable to testing various interventions, including mean arterial pressure augmentation (n = 7), electrical stimulation (n = 6), stem cell therapy (n = 5), hypothermia (n = 2), biomaterials (n = 2), gene therapy (n = 2), steroids (n = 1), and nanoparticles (n = 1). It is also notable for its clinical translatability and is emerging as a valuable pre-clinical study tool. This systematic review can serve as a guideline for researchers implementing and testing the porcine SCI model."
Oligodendrocyte fate after spinal cord injury,"Almad A, Sahinkaya FR, McTigue DM.","AB  - Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is typically the result of direct mechanical impact to the spine, leading to fracture and/or dislocation of the vertebrae along with damage to the surrounding soft tissues. Injury to the spinal cord results in disruption of axonal transmission of signals. This primary trauma causes secondary injuries that produce immunological responses such as neuroinflammation, which perpetuates neurodegeneration and cytotoxicity within the injured spinal cord. To date there is no FDA-approved pharmacological agent to prevent the development of secondary SCI and induce regenerative processes aimed at healing the spinal cord and restoring neurological function. An alternative method to electrically activate spinal circuits is the application of a noninvasive electromagnetic field (EMF) over intact vertebrae. The EMF method of modulating molecular signaling of inflammatory cells emitted in the extra-low frequency range of <100 Hz, and field strengths of <5 mT, has been reported to decrease inflammatory markers in macrophages, and increase endogenous mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) proliferation and differentiation rates. EMF has been reported to promote osteogenesis by improving the effects of osteogenic media, and increasing the proliferation of osteoblasts, while inhibiting osteoclast formation and increasing bone matrix in vitro. EMF has also been shown to increase chondrogenic markers and collagen and induce neural differentiation, while increasing cell viability by over 50%. As advances are made in stem cell technologies, stabilizing the cell line after differentiation is crucial to SCI repair. Once cell-seeded scaffolds are implanted, EMF may be applied outside the wound for potential continued adjunct treatment during recovery."
Multiple strategies enhance the efficacy of MSCs transplantation for spinal cord injury,"Pang QM, Deng KQ, Zhang M, Wu XC, Yang RL, Fu SP, Lin FQ, Zhang Q, Ao J, Zhang T.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a traumatic event resulting in disturbances to normal sensory, motor, or autonomic functions, which ultimately impacts a patient's physical, psychological, and social well-being. Until now, no available therapy for SCI can effectively slow down or halt the disease progression. Compared to traditional treatments, e.g., medication, surgery, and functional electrical stimulation, stem cell replacement therapy shows high potential for repair and functional plasticity. Thus, stem cell therapy may provide a promising strategy in curative treatment of SCI, specifically when considering the requirement of neuron replenishment in the spinal cord after distinct acute injuries. However, the therapeutic application of neural stem cells (NSCs) still faces enormous challenges, such as ethical issues, possible inflammatory reactions, graft rejection, and tumor formation. Therefore, it is of vital interest to identify more suitable sources of cells with stem cell potential, which might potentially be harnessed for local neural repair. Due to abovementioned possible drawbacks, these cells should be autologous. Reprogramming of astrocytes to generate the desired neuronal cell types would open the door to autologous cell transplantation and treatment of SCI without possible severe side effects. In this paper, we review the relevant therapeutic strategies for SCI, and conversion of astrocyte into NSCs, suggesting this procedure as a possible treatment option."
Is TGR5 a therapeutic target for the treatment of spinal cord injury?,"Smaling A, Romero-Ramírez L, Mey J.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) results from various pathogenic factors that destroy the normal structure and function of the spinal cord, subsequently causing sensory, motor, and autonomic nerve dysfunction. SCI is one of the most common causes of disability and death globally. It leads to severe physical and mental injury to patients and causes a substantial economic burden on families and the society. The pathological changes and underlying mechanisms within SCI involve oxidative stress, apoptosis, inflammation, etc. As a traditional therapy, acupuncture has a positive effect promoting the recovery of SCI. Acupuncture-induced neuroprotection includes several mechanisms such as reducing oxidative stress, inhibiting the inflammatory response and neuronal apoptosis, alleviating glial scar formation, promoting neural stem cell differentiation, and improving microcirculation within the injured area. Therefore, the recent studies exploring the mechanism of acupuncture therapy in SCI will help provide a theoretical basis for applying acupuncture and seeking a better treatment target and acupuncture approach for SCI patients."
Mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of spinal cord injuries: A review,"Dasari VR, Veeravalli KK, Dinh DH.","AB  - Traumatic injury of the central nervous system (CNS) is a worldwide health problem affecting millions of people. Trauma of the CNS, that is, traumatic brain injury (TBI) and spinal cord injury (SCI), lead to massive and progressive cell loss and axonal degeneration, usually with very limited regeneration. At present, there are no treatments to protect injured CNS tissue or to replace the lost tissue. Stem cells are a cell type that by definition can self-renew and give rise to multiple cell lineages. In recent years, therapies using stem and progenitor cells have shown promising effects in experimental CNS trauma, particularly in the acute-subacute stage, but also in chronic injuries. However, the therapeutic mechanisms by which transplanted cells achieve the structural and/or functional improvements are often not clear. Stem cell therapies for CNS trauma can be categorized into 2 main concepts, transplantation of exogenous neural stem cells and neural progenitor cells and recruitment of endogenous stem and progenitor cells. In this review, focusing on the advances during the last decade, we will discuss the major cell therapies, the pros and cons of these 2 concepts for TBI and SCI, and the treatment strategies we believe will be successful."
iPSC-derived neural precursor cells: potential for cell transplantation therapy in spinal cord injury,"Nagoshi N, Okano H.","AB  - Stem cell transplantation for spinal cord injury (SCI) along with new pharmacotherapy research offers the potential to restore function and ease the associated social and economic burden in the years ahead. Various sources of stem cells have been used in the treatment of SCI, but the most convincing results have been obtained with neural progenitor cells in preclinical models. Although the use of cell-based transplantation strategies for the repair of chronic SCI remains the long sought after holy grail, these approaches have been to date the most successful when applied in the subacute phase of injury. Application of cell-based strategies for the repair and regeneration of the chronically injured spinal cord will require a combinational strategy that may need to include approaches to overcome the effects of the glial scar, inhibitory molecules, and use of tissue engineering strategies to bridge the lesion. Nonetheless, cell transplantation strategies are promising, and it is anticipated that the Phase I clinical trials of some form of neural stem cell-based approach in SCI will commence very soon."
"Challenges of stem cell therapy for spinal cord injury: human embryonic stem cells, endogenous neural stem cells, or induced pluripotent stem cells?","Ronaghi M, Erceg S, Moreno-Manzano V, Stojkovic M.","AB  - Traffic accidents, falls, and many other events may cause traumatic spinal cord injuries (SCIs), resulting in nerve cells and extracellular matrix loss in the spinal cord, along with blood loss, inflammation, oxidative stress (OS), and others. The continuous development of neural tissue engineering has attracted increasing attention on the application of fibrin hydrogels in repairing SCIs. Except for excellent biocompatibility, flexibility, and plasticity, fibrin, a component of extracellular matrix (ECM), can be equipped with cells, ECM protein, and various growth factors to promote damage repair. This review will focus on the advantages and disadvantages of fibrin hydrogels from different sources, as well as the various modifications for internal topographical guidance during the polymerization. From the perspective of further improvement of cell function before and after the delivery of stem cell, cytokine, and drug, this review will also evaluate the application of fibrin hydrogels as a carrier to the therapy of nerve repair and regeneration, to mirror the recent development tendency and challenge."
Delving into the recent advancements of spinal cord injury treatment: a review of recent progress,"Flack JA, Sharma KD, Xie JY.","AB  - Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) have emerged as attractive candidates for cell-based therapies that are capable of restoring lost cell and tissue function. These unique cells are able to self-renew indefinitely and have the capacity to differentiate in to all three germ layers (ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm). Harnessing the power of these pluripotent stem cells could potentially offer new therapeutic treatment options for a variety of medical conditions. Since the initial derivation of hESC lines in 1998, tremendous headway has been made in better understanding stem cell biology and culture requirements for maintenance of pluripotency. The approval of the first clinical trials of hESC cells for treatment of spinal cord injury and macular degeneration in 2010 marked the beginning of a new era in regenerative medicine. Yet it was clearly recognized that the clinical utility of hESC transplantation was still limited by several challenges. One of the most immediate issues has been the exposure of stem cells to animal pathogens, during hESC derivation and during in vitro propagation. Initial culture protocols used co-culture with inactivated mouse fibroblast feeder (MEF) or human feeder layers with fetal bovine serum or alternatively serum replacement proteins to support stem cell proliferation. Most hESC lines currently in use have been exposed to animal products, thus carrying the risk of xeno-transmitted infections and immune reaction. This mini review provides a historic perspective on human embryonic stem cell culture and the evolution of new culture models. We highlight the challenges and advances being made towards the development of xeno-free culture systems suitable for therapeutic applications."
Cell therapy in spinal cord injury: a mini- reivew,"Mehrabi S, Eftekhari S, Moradi F, Delaviz H, Pourheidar B, Azizi M, Zendehdel A, Shahbazi A, Joghataei MT.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) represents a devastating injury to the central nervous system (CNS) that is responsible for impaired mobility and sensory function in SCI patients. The hallmarks of SCI include neuroinflammation, axonal degeneration, neuronal loss, and reactive gliosis. Current strategies, including stem cell transplantation, have not led to successful clinical therapy. MiRNAs are crucial for the differentiation of neural cell types during CNS development, as well as for pathological processes after neural injury including SCI. This makes them ideal candidates for therapy in this condition. Indeed, several studies have demonstrated the involvement of miRNAs that are expressed differently in CNS injury. In this context, the purpose of the review is to provide an overview of the pre-clinical evidence evaluating the use of miRNA therapy in SCI. Specifically, we have focused our attention on miRNAs that are widely associated with neuronal and axon regeneration.

The Application of Neural Stem/Progenitor Cells for Regenerative Therapy of Spinal Cord Injury,"Yu C, Xia K, Gong Z, Ying L, Shu J, Zhang F, Chen Q, Li F, Liang C.","AB  - Bile acids, which are synthesized in liver and colon, facilitate the digestion of dietary lipids. In addition to this metabolic function, they also act as molecular signals with activities in the nervous system. These are mediated primarily by a G-protein-coupled bile acid receptor (known as TGR5). Preceded by a long tradition in Chinese medicine, bile acids are now being investigated as therapeutic options in several neuropathologies. Specifically, one bile acid, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), which passes the blood-brain barrier and shows anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, has been tested in animal models of spinal cord injury (SCI). In this review, we discuss the evidence for a therapeutic benefit in these preclinical experiments. At the time of writing, 12 studies with TGR5 agonists have been published that report functional outcomes with rodent models of SCI. Most investigations found cytoprotective effects and benefits regarding the recovery of sensorimotor function in the subacute phase. When TUDCA was applied in a hydrogel into the lesion site, a significant improvement was obtained at 2 weeks after SCI. However, no lasting improvements with TUDCA treatment were found, when animals were assessed in later, chronic stages. A combination of TUDCA with stem cell injection failed to improve the effect of the cellular treatment. We conclude that the evidence does not support the use of TUDCA as a treatment of SCI. Nevertheless, cytoprotective effects suggest that different modes of application or combinatorial therapies might still be explored."
Biomaterial Strategies for Delivering Stem Cells as a Treatment for Spinal Cord Injury,"Agbay A, Edgar JM, Robinson M, Styan T, Wilson K, Schroll J, Ko J, Khadem Mohtaram N, Jun MB, Willerth SM.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a serious complication of the central nervous system (CNS) after spine injury, often resulting in severe sensory, motor, and autonomic dysfunction below the level of injury. To date, there is no effective treatment strategy for SCI. Recently, stem cell therapy has brought hope to patients with neurological diseases. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are considered to be the most promising source of cellular therapy after SCI due to their immunomodulatory, neuroprotective and angiogenic potential. Considering the limited therapeutic effect of MSCs due to the complex pathophysiological environment following SCI, this paper not only reviews the specific mechanism of MSCs to facilitate SCI repair, but also further discusses the research status of these pluripotent stem cells combined with other therapeutic approaches to promote anatomical and functional recovery post-SCI."

Multipotent Neurotrophic Effects of Hepatocyte Growth Factor in Spinal Cord Injury,"Yamane K, Misawa H, Takigawa T, Ito Y, Ozaki T, Matsukawa A.","AB  - Introduction: Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) results from primary physical injury to the spinal cord, which initiates a secondary cascade of neural cell death. Current therapeutic approaches can attenuate the consequences of the primary and secondary events, but do not address the degenerative aspects of SCI. Transplantation of neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs) for the replacement of the lost/damaged neural cells is suggested here as a regenerative approach that is complementary to current therapeutics.Areas Covered: This review addresses how neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes are impacted by traumatic SCI, and how current research in regenerative-NPC therapeutics aims to restore their functionality. Methods used to enhance graft survival, as well as bias progenitor cells towards neuronal, oligodendrogenic, and astroglia lineages are discussed.Expert Opinion: Despite an NPC's ability to differentiate into neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes in the transplant environment, their potential therapeutic efficacy requires further optimization prior to translation into the clinic. Considering the temporospatial identity of NPCs could promote neural repair in region specific injuries throughout the spinal cord. Moreover, understanding which cells are targeted by NPC-derived myelinating cells can help restore physiologically-relevant myelin patterns. Finally, the duality of astrocytes is discussed, outlining their context-dependent importance in the treatment of SCI."
Concise review: the potential of stromal cell-derived factor 1 and its receptors to promote stem cell functions in spinal cord repair,"Jaerve A, Schira J, Müller HW.","AB  - Transplantation therapies aimed at repairing neurodegenerative and neuropathological conditions of the central nervous system (CNS) have utilized and tested a variety of cell candidates, each with its own unique set of advantages and disadvantages. The use and popularity of each cell type is guided by a number of factors including the nature of the experimental model, neuroprotection capacity, the ability to promote plasticity and guided axonal growth, and the cells' myelination capability. The promise of stem cells, with their reported ability to give rise to neuronal lineages to replace lost endogenous cells and myelin, integrate into host tissue, restore functional connectivity, and provide trophic support to enhance and direct intrinsic regenerative ability, has been seen as a most encouraging step forward.

Yamanaka and his colleagues established induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) which could be generated from somatic cells, and this innovative development has made rapid progression in the field of SCI regeneration. We and other groups succeeded in producing NPCs from iPSCs, and demonstrated beneficial effects after transplantation for animal models of SCI. In particular, efficacy of human iPSC-NPCs in non-human primate SCI models fostered momentum of clinical application for SCI patients. At the same time, however, artificial induction methods in iPSC technology created alternative issues including genetic and epigenetic abnormalities, and tumorigenicity after transplantation. To overcome these problems, it is critically important to select origins of somatic cells, use integration-free system during transfection of reprogramming factors, and thoroughly investigate the characteristics of iPSC-NPCs with respect to quality management. Moreover, since most of the previous studies have focused on subacute phase of SCI, establishment of effective NPC transplantation should be evaluated for chronic phase hereafter. Our group is currently preparing clinical-grade human iPSC-NPCs, and will move forward toward clinical study for subacute SCI patients soon in the near future."
Taking a bite out of spinal cord injury: do dental stem cells have the teeth for it?,"Bianco J, De Berdt P, Deumens R, des Rieux A.","AB  - Spinal cord injury is a devastating disease which disrupts the connections between the brain and spinal cord, often resulting in the loss of sensory and motor function below the lesion site. Most injured neurons fail to regenerate in the central nervous system after injury. Multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors contribute to the general failure of axonal regeneration after injury. MicroRNAs can modulate multiple genes' expression and are tightly controlled during nerve development or the injury process. Evidence has demonstrated that microRNAs and their signaling pathways play important roles in mediating axon regeneration and glial scar formation after spinal cord injury. This article reviews the role and mechanism of differentially expressed microRNAs in regulating axon regeneration and glial scar formation after spinal cord injury, as well as their therapeutic potential for promoting axonal regeneration and repair of the injured spinal cord."
Natural and bio-engineered stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles for spinal cord injury repair: A meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis,"Su H, Chen Y, Tang B, Xiao F, Sun Y, Chen J, Deng L, He A, Li G, Luo Y, Li H.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating event, and there are still no effective therapies currently available. Neural stem cells (NSCs) have gained increasing attention as promising regenerative therapy of SCI. NSCs based therapies of various neural diseases in animal models and clinical trials have been widely investigated. In this review we aim to summarize the development and recent progress in the application of NSCs in cell transplantation therapy for SCI. After brief introduction on sequential genetic steps regulating spinal cord development in vivo, we describe current experimental approaches for neural induction of NSCs in vitro. In particular, we focus on NSCs induced from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Finally, we highlight recent progress on the NSCs, which show great promise in the application to regeneration therapy for SCI."
Concise Review: Bridging the Gap: Novel Neuroregenerative and Neuroprotective Strategies in Spinal Cord Injury,"Ahuja CS, Fehlings M.","AB  - Transected axons are unable to regenerate after spinal cord injury (SCI). Glial scar is thought to be responsible for this failure. Regulating the formation of glial scar post-SCI may contribute to axonal regrow. Over the past few decades, studies have found that the interaction between immune cells at the damaged site results in a robust and persistent inflammatory response. Current therapy strategies focus primarily on the inhibition of subacute and chronic neuroinflammation after the acute inflammatory response was executed. Growing evidences have documented that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) engraftment can be served as a promising cell therapy for SCI. Numerous studies have shown that MSCs transplantation can inhibit the excessive glial scar formation as well as inflammatory response, thereby facilitating the anatomical and functional recovery. Here, we will review the effects of inflammatory response and glial scar formation in spinal cord injury and repair. The role of MSCs in regulating neuroinflammation and glial scar formation after SCI will be reviewed as well."
Current advancements in the management of spinal cord injury: A comprehensive review of literature,"Shah M, Peterson C, Yilmaz E, Halalmeh DR, Moisi M.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in neural tissue loss and so far untreatable functional impairment. In addition, at the initial injury site, inflammation induces secondary damage, and glial scar formation occurs to limit inflammation-mediated tissue damage. Consequently, it obstructs neural regeneration. Many studies have been conducted in the field of SCI; however, no satisfactory treatment has been established to date. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is one of the neurotrophic growth factors and has been listed as a candidate medicine for SCI treatment. The highlighted effects of HGF on neural regeneration are associated with its anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic activities. Moreover, HGF exerts positive effects on transplanted stem cell differentiation into neurons. This paper reviews the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of HGF in SCI recovery, and introduces recent advances in the clinical applications of HGF therapy."
Current status of cell-mediated regenerative therapies for human spinal cord injury,"Zhu T, Tang Q, Gao H, Shen Y, Chen L, Zhu J.","AB  - Autonomic dysreflexia (AD) is a serious cardiovascular disorder in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). The primary underlying cause of AD is loss of supraspinal control over sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPNs) caudal to the injury, which renders the SPNs hyper-responsive to stimulation. Central maladaptive plasticity, including C-fiber sprouting and propriospinal fiber proliferation exaggerates noxious afferent transmission to the SPNs, causing them to release massive sympathetic discharges that result in severe hypertensive episodes. In parallel, upregulated peripheral vascular sensitivity following SCI exacerbates the hypertensive response by augmenting gastric and pelvic vasoconstriction. Currently, the majority of clinically employed treatments for AD involve anti-hypertensive medications and Botox injections to the bladder. Although these approaches mitigate the severity of AD, they only yield transient effects and target the effector organs, rather than addressing the primary issue of central sympathetic dysregulation. As such, strategies that aim to restore supraspinal reinnervation of SPNs to improve cardiovascular sympathetic regulation are likely more effective for AD. Recent pre-clinical investigations show that cell transplantation therapy is efficacious in reestablishing spinal sympathetic connections and improving hemodynamic performance, which holds promise as a potential therapeutic approach."
Harnessing the power of cell transplantation to target respiratory dysfunction following spinal cord injury,"Charsar BA, Urban MW, Lepore AC.","AB  - BACKGROUND: Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating neurologic entity characterized by a primary insult followed by a secondary pathologic cascade that propagates further injury. Hypothermia has an established clinical role in preventing SCI after cardiac arrest and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair, yet its emergence as a potential neuroprotectant after spinal cord trauma remains experimental. There are currently no pharmacologic interventions available to prevent secondary mechanisms of injury after spinal cord trauma. METHODS: Systematic review of literature. RESULTS: Experimental studies demonstrated that hypothermia diminishes secondary pathomechanisms, such as ischemia, oxidative stress, apoptosis, inflammation, and edema. Early onset and longer durations of hypothermia as well as concomitant steroids or neural stem cell engraftment combined with hypothermia appear to improve functional and histologic outcomes in animal models of spinal cord trauma. Recent clinical studies provide evidence that localized and systemic hypothermia may be applied safely and efficaciously in patients with severe acute SCI. Randomized clinical trials are needed to better evaluate optimal cooling parameters and the effectiveness of hypothermia after traumatic SCI. CONCLUSION: Although variability exists in the literature, therapeutic hypothermia most likely confers neuroprotection after spinal cord trauma by diminishing the destructive secondary cascade. The available clinical data suggest that regional and systemic hypothermia is a relatively safe and feasible initial treatment modality for patients with acute SCI when combined with surgical decompression/stabilization with or without steroids. However, establishing a clinical role for therapeutic hypothermia after spinal cord trauma will invariably depend on future well-designed, multicentered, randomized, controlled clinical trial data."
Disease and Stem Cell-Based Analysis of the 2013 ASNTR Meeting,Eve DJ.,"AB  - Transplanted stem cells provide beneficial effects on regeneration/recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) by the release of growth-promoting factors, increased tissue preservation, and provision of a permissive environment for axon regeneration. A rise in chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1/CXCL12) expression levels in central nervous system (CNS) injury sites has been shown to play a central role in recruiting transplanted stem cells. Although technically more challenging, it has been shown that after SCI few endogenous stem cells are recruited via SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling. Evidence is accumulating that increasing SDF-1 levels at the injury site (e.g., by exogenous application or transfection methods) further enhances stem cell recruitment. Moreover, SDF-1 might, in addition to migration, also influence survival, proliferation, differentiation, and cytokine secretion of stem cells. Here, we discuss the experimental data available on the role of SDF-1 in stem and progenitor cell biology following CNS injury and suggest strategies for how manipulation of the SDF-1 system could facilitate stem cell-based therapeutic approaches in SCI. In addition, we discuss challenges such as how to circumvent off-target effects in order to facilitate the transfer of SDF-1 to the clinic."
Time is spine: a review of translational advances in spinal cord injury,"Badhiwala JH, Ahuja CS, Fehlings MG.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes myelopathy, damage to white matter, and myelinated fiber tracts that carry sensation and motor signals to and from the brain. The gray matter damage causes segmental losses of interneurons and motoneurons and restricts therapeutic options. Recent advances in stem cell biology, neural injury, and repair, and the progress toward development of neuroprotective and regenerative interventions are the basis for increased optimism. This review summarizes the pathophysiological mechanisms following SCI and compares human embryonic, adult neural, and the induced pluripotent stem cell-based therapeutic strategies for SCI."
Biomaterials targeting the microenvironment for spinal cord injury repair: progression and perspectives,"Gao Y, Wang Y, Wu Y, Liu S.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts the long axonal tracts of the spinal cord leading to devastating loss of function. Cell transplantation in the injured spinal cord has the potential to lead to recovery after SCI via a variety of mechanisms. One such strategy is the formation of neuronal relays between injured long tract axons and denervated neurons. The idea of creating a neuronal relay was first proposed over 25 years ago when fetal tissue was first successfully transplanted into the injured rodent spinal cord. Advances in labeling of grafted cells and the development of neural stem cell culturing techniques have improved the ability to create and refine such relays. Several recent studies have examined the ability to create a novel neuronal circuit between injured axons and denervated targets. This approach is an alternative to long-distance regeneration of damaged axons that may provide a meaningful degree of recovery without direct recreation of lost pathways. This brief review will examine the contribution of fetal grafting to current advances in neuronal grafting. Of particular interest will be the ability of transplanted neurons derived from fetal grafts, neural precursor cells and neural stem cells to reconnect long distance motor and sensory pathways of the injured spinal cord. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled SI: Spinal cord injury."
Regenerative medicine approaches for the treatment of spinal cord injuries: Progress and challenges,"Ralph PC, Choi SW, Baek MJ, Lee SJ.","AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinal cord injury (SCI) carries debilitating lifelong consequences and, therefore, requires careful review of different treatment strategies. METHODS: An extensive review of the English literature (PubMed 1990 and 2019) was performed regarding recent advances in the treatment of SCI; this included 46 articles written over 28 years. RESULTS: Results of this search were divided into five major modalities; neuroprotective and neuroregenerative pharmaceuticals, neuromodulation, stem cell-based therapies, and various external prosthetic devices. Lately, therapeutic strategies were mainly focused on two major areas: neuroregeneration and neuroprotection. CONCLUSION: Despite recent advancements, more clinical trials on a larger scale and further research are needed to provide better treatment modalities of this devastating neurological disease."
An update on spinal cord injury research,"Cao HQ, Dong ED.","AB  - Acute traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating event with far-reaching physical, emotional, and economic consequences for patients, families, and society at large. Timely delivery of specialized care has reduced mortality; however, long-term neurological recovery continues to be limited. In recent years, a number of exciting neuroprotective and regenerative strategies have emerged and have come under active investigation in clinical trials, and several more are coming down the translational pipeline. Among ongoing trials are RISCIS (riluzole), INSPIRE (Neuro-Spinal Scaffold), MASC (minocycline), and SPRING (VX-210). Microstructural MRI techniques have improved our ability to image the injured spinal cord at high resolution. This innovation, combined with serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, holds the promise of providing a quantitative biomarker readout of spinal cord neural tissue injury, which may improve prognostication and facilitate stratification of patients for enrollment into clinical trials. Given evidence of the effectiveness of early surgical decompression and growing recognition of the concept that time is spine"
Stem cells for spinal cord repair,"Barnabé-Heider F, Frisén J.","AB  - Complex circuitry and limited regenerative power make central nervous system (CNS) disorders the most challenging and difficult for functional repair. With elusive disease mechanisms, traditional surgical and medical interventions merely slow down the progression of the neurodegenerative diseases. However, the number of neurons still diminishes in many patients. Recently, stem cell therapy has been proposed as a viable option. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), a widely-studied human adult stem cell population, have been discovered for more than 20 years. MSCs have been found all over the body and can be conveniently obtained from different accessible tissues: bone marrow, blood, and adipose and dental tissue. MSCs have high proliferative and differentiation abilities, providing an inexhaustible source of neurons and glia for cell replacement therapy. Moreover, MSCs also show neuroprotective effects without any genetic modification or reprogramming. In addition, the extraordinary immunomodulatory properties of MSCs enable autologous and heterologous transplantation. These qualities heighten the clinical applicability of MSCs when dealing with the pathologies of CNS disorders. Here, we summarize the latest progress of MSC experimental research as well as human clinical trials for neural and retinal diseases. This review article will focus on multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, autism, glaucoma, retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration."
Neural stem cells for spinal cord repair,"Sandner B, Prang P, Rivera FJ, Aigner L, Blesch A, Weidner N.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes the irreversible loss of spinal cord parenchyma including astroglia, oligodendroglia and neurons. In particular, severe injuries can lead to an almost complete neural cell loss at the lesion site and structural and functional recovery might only be accomplished by appropriate cell and tissue replacement. Stem cells have the capacity to differentiate into all relevant neural cell types necessary to replace degenerated spinal cord tissue and can now be obtained from virtually any stage of development. Within the last two decades, many in vivo studies in small animal models of SCI have demonstrated that stem cell transplantation can promote morphological and, in some cases, functional recovery via various mechanisms including remyelination, axon growth and regeneration, or neuronal replacement. However, only two well-documented neural-stem-cell-based transplantation strategies have moved to phase I clinical trials to date. This review aims to provide an overview about the current status of preclinical and clinical neural stem cell transplantation and discusses future perspectives in the field."
"Application of""Spinal cord fusion"" in spinal cord injury repair and its neurological mechanism","Shen T, Zhang W, Wang X, Ren X.","AB  - Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the use of stem cells as a way to treat traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the inhibitory environment present in the injured spinal cord makes it challenging to achieve the survival of these cells along with desired differentiation into the appropriate phenotypes necessary to regain function. Transplanting stem cells along with an instructive biomaterial scaffold can increase cell survival and improve differentiation efficiency. This study reviews the literature discussing different types of instructive biomaterial scaffolds developed for transplanting stem cells into the injured spinal cord. We have chosen to focus specifically on biomaterial scaffolds that direct the differentiation of neural stem cells and pluripotent stem cells since they offer the most promise for producing the cell phenotypes that could restore function after SCI. In terms of biomaterial scaffolds, this article reviews the literature associated with using hydrogels made from natural biomaterials and electrospun scaffolds for differentiating stem cells into neural phenotypes. It then presents new data showing how these different types of scaffolds can be combined for neural tissue engineering applications and provides directions for future studies."
Cell Therapy Augments Functional Recovery Subsequent to Spinal Cord Injury under Experimental Conditions,"Sabapathy V, Tharion G, Kumar S.","AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease, is among the most prevalent rheumatic autoimmune disorders. It affects autologous connective tissues caused by the breakdown of self-tolerance mechanisms. During the last two decades, stem cell therapy has been increasingly considered as a therapeutic option in various diseases, including parkinson's disease, alzheimer, stroke, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, liver disease, diabete, heart disease, bone disease, renal disease, respiratory diseases, and hematological abnormalities such as anemia. This is due to the unique properties of stem cells that divide and differentiate to the specialized cells in the damaged tissues. Moreover, they impose immunomodulatory properties affecting the diseases caused by immunological abnormalities such as rheumatic autoimmune disorders. In the present manuscript, efficacy of stem cell therapy with two main types of stem cells, including mesenchymal stem cell (MSC), and hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in animal models or human patients of SLE, has been reviewed. Taken together, MSC and HSC therapies improved the disease activity, and severity in kidney, lung, liver, and bone (improvement in the clinical manifestation). In addition, a change in the immunological parameters occurred (improvement in immunological parameters). The level of autoantibodies, including antinuclear antibody (ANA), and anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid antibodies (dsDNA Abs) reduced. A conversion of Th1/Th2 ratio (in favor of Th2), and Th17/Treg (in favor of Treg) was also detected. In spite of many advantages of MSC and HSC transplantations, including efficacy, safety, and increased survival rate of SLE patients, some complications, including recurrence of the disease, occurrence of infections, and secondary autoimmune diseases (SAD) were observed after transplantation that should be addressed in the next studies."
Can a Scaffold Enriched with Mesenchymal Stem Cells Be a Good Treatment for Spinal Cord Injury?,"Blando S, Anchesi I, Mazzon E, Gugliandolo A.","AB  - The therapeutic benefit of cell transplantation has been assessed in a host of central nervous system (CNS) diseases, including disorders of the spinal cord such as traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). The promise of cell transplantation to preserve and/or restore normal function can be aimed at a variety of therapeutic mechanisms, including replacement of lost or damaged CNS cell types, promotion of axonal regeneration or sprouting, neuroprotection, immune response modulation, and delivery of gene products such as neurotrophic factors, amongst other possibilities. Despite significant work in the field of transplantation in models of SCI, limited attention has been directed at harnessing the therapeutic potential of cell grafting for preserving respiratory function after SCI, despite the critical role pulmonary compromise plays in patient outcome in this devastating disease. Here, we will review the limited number of studies that have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of intraspinal transplantation of a variety of cell types for addressing respiratory dysfunction in SCI."
Systematic Review of Cell Therapy Efficacy in Human Chronic Spinal Cord Injury,"Abolghasemi R, Davoudi-Monfared E, Allahyari F, Farzanegan G.","AB  - Spinal cord injury results in cell loss, disruption of neural circuitry and chronic functional impairment. Several different cell types generate progeny in response to injury, which participate in scar formation and remyelination. Work over the last few years has identified neural stem cells and delineated the stem cell potential of different cell populations in the adult spinal cord under homeostasis and in response to injury. Neural stem cell properties are contained within the ependymal cell population, and these cells generate the majority of new astrocytes forming the glial scar. Oligodendrocyte progenitors give rise to myelinating oligodendrocytes in the intact spinal cord. They also generate the majority of remyelinating oligodendrocytes after spinal cord injury, with a minor contribution by ependymal cells. The fibrotic component of the scar tissue is generated by a subtype of pericytes. A better understanding of the regulation and precise function of different cells in the response to injury may aid in the development of regenerative strategies."
The combination of induced pluripotent stem cells and bioscaffolds holds promise for spinal cord regeneration,"DeBrot A, Yao L.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) research is a very complex field lending to why reviews of SCI literatures can be beneficial to current and future researchers. This review focuses on recent articles regarding potential modalities for the treatment and management of SCI. The modalities were broken down into four categories: neuroprotection-pharmacologic, neuroprotection-non-pharmacologic, neuroregeneration-pharmacologic, neuroregeneration-non-pharmacologic. Peer-reviewed articles were found using PubMed with search terms: spinal cord injury"""
Novel Strategies for Spinal Cord Regeneration,"Costăchescu B, Niculescu AG, Dabija MG, Teleanu RI, Grumezescu AM, Eva L.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating disease which leads to progressive functional damages. Because of limited axonal regeneration in the central nervous system, there is no or little recovery expected in the patients. Different cellular and molecular approaches were investigated in SCI animal models. Cellular transplantation of stem cells can potentially replace damaged tissue and provide a suitable microenvironment for axons to regenerate. Here, we reviewed the last approaches applied by our colleagues and others in order to improve axonal regeneration following SCI. We used different types of stem cells via different methods. First, fetal olfactory mucosa, schwann, and bone marrow stromal cells were transplanted into the injury sites in SCI models. In later studies, was applied simultaneous transplantation of stem cells with chondroitinase ABC in SCI models with the aid of nanoparticles. Using these approaches, considerable functional recovery was observed. However, considering some challenges in stem cell therapy such as rejection, infection, and development of a new cancer, our more recent strategy was application of cytokines. We observed a significant improvement in motor function of rats when stromal derived factor-1 was used to attract innate stem cells to the injury site. In conclusion, it seems that co-transplantation of different cells accompanies with other factors like enzymes and growth factors via new delivery systems may yield better results in SCI."
The neuronal differentiation microenvironment is essential for spinal cord injury repair,"Zhao Y, Xiao Z, Chen B, Dai J.","AB  - Spinal cord injuries (SCIs) are debilitating conditions for which no effective treatment currently exists. The damage of neural tissue causes disruption of neural tracts and neuron loss in the spinal cord. Stem cell replacement offers a solution for SCI treatment by providing a source of therapeutic cells for neural function restoration. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been investigated as a potential type of stem cell for such therapies. Transplantation of iPSCs has been shown to be effective in restoring function after SCIs in animal models while they circumvent ethical and immunological concerns produced by other stem cell types. Another approach for the treatment of SCI involves the graft of a bioscaffold at the site of injury to create a microenvironment that enhances cellular viability and guides the growing axons. Studies suggest that a combination of these two treatment methods could have a synergistic effect on functional recovery post-neural injury. While much progress has been made, more research is needed before clinical trials are possible. This review highlights recent advancements using iPSCs and bioscaffolds for treatment of SCI."
Role of Circular Ribonucleic Acids in the Treatment of Traumatic Brain and Spinal Cord Injury,"Yuan J, Botchway BOA, Zhang Y, Wang X, Liu X.","AB  - The causal and pathogenetic factors linked to traumatic brain injury (TBI) and spinal cord injury (SCI) are complex. This complexity is a contributive factor in the minimal improvement outcomes of injured individuals. Several studies have demonstrated the potentiality of stem cells in facilitating neuronal growth and improve outcome in various neurological conditions, including TBI and SCI. However, the efficiency concerning stem cell delivery at injured sites is open to question. Circular ribonucleic acids (circular RNAs) have recently been the focus of attention owing to their disparate functions and features in vivo. Exosomes have close relationship with circular RNAs and might have a significant impact on circular RNA expressions. Herein, we reviewed the specific functions of circular RNAs, exosomes, and stem cells in central nervous system conditions, particularly TBI and SCI, and attempted to show the connection among them. Our analyses showed the role of circular RNAs in brain/spinal cord injuries to be multifaceted, as they can modulate several signaling mechanisms while also acting as sponges for microRNAs and binding to their sites. Additionally, circular RNAs can activate several biological, molecular, and cellular activities in the wake of brain/spinal cord injuries. Thus, both non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions centered on the regulation of circular RNAs could be promising for TBI and SCI."
Cell-based transplantation strategies to promote plasticity following spinal cord injury,"Ruff CA, Wilcox JT, Fehlings MG.","AB  - Cell transplantation therapy holds potential for repair and functional plasticity following spinal cord injury (SCI). Stem and progenitor cells are capable of modifying the lesion environment, providing structural support and myelination and increasing neurotrophic factors for neuroprotection and endogenous activation. Through these effects, transplanted cells induce plasticity in the injured spinal cord by promoting axonal elongation and collateral sprouting, remyelination, synapse formation and reduced retrograde axonal degeneration. In light of these beneficial effects, cell transplantation could be combined with other treatment modalities, such as rehabilitation and immune modulation, to provide a synergistic functional benefit. This review will delineate 1) stem/progenitor cell types proposed for cell transplantation in SCI, 2) in vitro evidence of cell-induced mechanisms of plasticity, 3) promotion of functional recovery in animal models of SCI, 4) successful combinatorial strategies using cell transplantation. Current treatment modalities for SCI provide modest efficacy, especially in chronic stages of SCI. Hence, combinatorial stem cell transplantation strategies which could potentially directly address tissue sparing and neuroplasticity in chronic SCI show promise. Rigorous evaluation of combinatorial approaches using stem cell transplantation with appropriate preclinical animal models of SCI is needed to advance therapeutic strategies to the point where clinical trials are appropriate. Given the high patient demand for and clinical trial precedent of cell transplantation therapy, combination stem cell therapies have the promise to provide improved quality of life for individuals, with corresponding socioeconomic benefit."
Innovative Strategies in 3D Bioprinting for Spinal Cord Injury Repair,"Kim DY, Liu Y, Kim G, An SB, Han I.","AB  - Oligodendrocytes (OLs) are particularly susceptible to the toxicity of the acute lesion environment after spinal cord injury (SCI). They undergo both necrosis and apoptosis acutely, with apoptosis continuing at chronic time points. Loss of OLs causes demyelination and impairs axon function and survival. In parallel, a rapid and protracted OL progenitor cell proliferative response occurs, especially at the lesion borders. Proliferating and migrating OL progenitor cells differentiate into myelinating OLs, which remyelinate demyelinated axons starting at 2 weeks post-injury. The progression of OL lineage cells into mature OLs in the adult after injury recapitulates development to some degree, owing to the plethora of factors within the injury milieu. Although robust, this endogenous oligogenic response is insufficient against OL loss and demyelination. First, in this review we analyze the major spatial-temporal mechanisms of OL loss, replacement, and myelination, with the purpose of highlighting potential areas of intervention after SCI. We then discuss studies on OL protection and replacement. Growth factors have been used both to boost the endogenous progenitor response, and in conjunction with progenitor transplantation to facilitate survival and OL fate. Considerable progress has been made with embryonic stem cell-derived cells and adult neural progenitor cells. For therapies targeting oligogenesis to be successful, endogenous responses and the effects of the acute and chronic lesion environment on OL lineage cells must be understood in detail, and in relation, the optimal therapeutic window for such strategies must also be determined."
Review of transplantation of neural stem/progenitor cells for spinal cord injury,"Mothe AJ, Tator CH.","AB  - Spinal surgery involves the bone-cartilage-neural interface. It is a field of surgery that is rapidly changing and evolving; not only through the development of novel techniques, approaches and devices but also through evidence from large clinical trials assessing indications, efficacy and outcomes. The use of biologics in spine surgery has now become widespread. Biologics in the form of autologous or allogeneic stem cells or progenitor cells are not yet in routine clinical use in spine surgery. However it is likely that they will have a significant role in the future, since increasing numbers of preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of progenitor cells to treat a variety of spinal conditions. Such studies have paved the way to larger clinical trials. Cell therapies encompass a wide range of stem cell and progenitor cell types. Stem cells subtypes differ in their lineage potential often being described as pluripotent or multipotent, some of which have potential application in therapies to treat diseases of the spine having the ability to differentiate into tissues including bone and cartilage and to secrete factors that promote matrix repair and regeneration. Furthermore, studies have shown that some cells, particularly mesenchymal stromal cells, modulate oxidative stress and secrete cytokines and growth factors that have immunomodulatory, antiinflammatory, angiogenic and antiapoptotic effects. It is these combined characteristics that make cell based therapies prime candidates for advancing current techniques in spine surgery and for providing new strategies directed at targeting the underlying causes of spinal diseases and disorders to promote repair and regeneration. This review will explore the characteristics of various stem cells and other progenitor cells derived from different sources. The authors are not suggesting that all these cells are necessarily suitable clinically. The review will thus focus on their application to both current and potentially future areas of spine surgery based on results of the available evidence and clinical trials. This review will not address spinal cord injury."
Glial and axonal regeneration following spinal cord injury,"Shibuya S, Yamamoto T, Itano T.","AB  - With technological advances in basic research, the intricate mechanism of secondary delayed spinal cord injury (SCI) continues to unravel at a rapid pace. However, despite our deeper understanding of the molecular changes occurring after initial insult to the spinal cord, the cure for paralysis remains elusive. Current treatment of SCI is limited to early administration of high dose steroids to mitigate the harmful effect of cord edema that occurs after SCI and to reduce the cascade of secondary delayed SCI. Recent evident-based clinical studies have cast doubt on the clinical benefit of steroids in SCI and intense focus on stem cell-based therapy has yielded some encouraging results. An array of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from various sources with novel and promising strategies are being developed to improve function after SCI. In this review, we briefly discuss the pathophysiology of spinal cord injuries and characteristics and the potential sources of MSCs that can be used in the treatment of SCI. We will discuss the progress of MSCs application in research, focusing on the neuroprotective properties of MSCs. Finally, we will discuss the results from preclinical and clinical trials involving stem cell-based therapy in SCI."
"Restorative Treatments for Cervical Spinal Cord Injury, a Narrative Review","Kaleem MI, Javeed S, Plog BA, Gupta VP, Ray WZ.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) often leads to substantial disability due to loss of motor function and sensation below the lesion. Neural stem cells (NSCs) are a promising strategy for SCI repair. However, NSCs rarely differentiate into neurons; they mostly differentiate into astrocytes because of the adverse microenvironment present after SCI. We have shown that myelin-associated inhibitors (MAIs) inhibited neuronal differentiation of NSCs. Given that MAIs activate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, we used a collagen scaffold-tethered anti-EGFR antibody to attenuate the inhibitory effects of MAIs and create a neuronal differentiation microenvironment for SCI repair. The collagen scaffold modified with anti-EGFR antibody prevented the inhibition of NSC neuronal differentiation by myelin. After transplantation into completely transected SCI animals, the scaffold-linked antibodies induced production of nascent neurons from endogenous and transplanted NSCs, which rebuilt the neuronal relay by forming connections with each other or host neurons to transmit electrophysiological signals and promote functional recovery. Thus, a scaffold-based strategy for rebuilding the neuronal differentiation microenvironment could be useful for SCI repair."
Molars to Medicine: A Focused Review on the Pre-Clinical Investigation and Treatment of Secondary Degeneration following Spinal Cord Injury Using Dental Stem Cells,"Jenkner S, Clark JM, Gronthos S, O'Hare Doig RL.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) has been regarded clinically as an irreversible damage caused by tissue contusion due to a blunt external force. Past research had focused on the analysis of the pathogenesis of secondary injury that extends from the injury epicenter to the periphery, as well as tissue damage and neural cell death associated with secondary injury. Recent studies, however, have proven that neural stem (progenitor) cells are also present in the brain and spinal cord of adult mammals including humans. Analyses using spinal cord injury models have also demonstrated active dynamics of cells expressing several stem cell markers, and methods aiming at functional reconstruction by promoting the potential self-regeneration capacity of the spinal cord are being explored. Furthermore, reconstruction of the neural circuit requires not only replenishment or regeneration of neural cells but also regeneration of axons. Analysis of the tissue microenvironment after spinal cord injury and research aiming to remove axonal regeneration inhibitors have also made progress. SCI is one of the simplest central nervous injuries, but its pathogenesis is associated with diverse factors, and further studies are required to elucidate these complex interactions in order to achieve spinal cord regeneration and functional reconstruction."
Tissue Engineering Approaches to Modulate the Inflammatory Milieu following Spinal Cord Injury,"Dumont CM, Margul DJ, Shea LD.","AB  - Dental stem cells are an emerging star on a stage that is already quite populated. Recently, there has been a lot of hype concerning these cells in dental therapies, especially in regenerative endodontics. It is fitting that most research is concentrated on dental regeneration, although other uses for these cells need to be explored in more detail. Being a true mesenchymal stem cell, their capacities could also prove beneficial in areas outside their natural environment. One such field is the central nervous system, and in particular, repairing the injured spinal cord. One of the most formidable challenges in regenerative medicine is to restore function to the injured spinal cord, and as yet, a cure for paralysis remains to be discovered. A variety of approaches have already been tested, with graft-based strategies utilising cells harbouring appropriate properties for neural regeneration showing encouraging results. Here we present a review focusing on properties of dental stem cells that endorse their use in regenerative medicine, with particular emphasis on repairing the damaged spinal cord."
Recent therapeutic strategies for spinal cord injury treatment: possible role of stem cells,"Garbossa D, Boido M, Fontanella M, Fronda C, Ducati A, Vercelli A.","AB  - Central nervous system (CNS) diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. By performing compensatory functions and improving the inflammatory microenvironment, the transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) can promote functional recovery from brain injury, aging, brain tumours, and other diseases. However, the ability of NSCs to differentiate into neurons is limited, and they are associated with a risk of tumourigenicity. NSC-derived extracellular vesicles (NSC-EVs) can modulate the local microenvironment of the nervous system as well as distant neuronal functions. Thus, cell-free therapy may be a novel remedy for CNS disorders. This article reviews the characteristics, contents, and mechanisms of action of NSC-EVs as well as their roles and application prospects in various CNS diseases."
"Enhancing regenerative potential: A comprehensive review of stem cell transplantation for sports-related neuronal injuries, with a focus on spinal cord injuries and peripheral nervous system damage","Bingnan W, Jiao T, Ghorbani A, Baghei S.","AB  - Spinal cord injuries (SCIs) result in devastating lifelong disability for patients and their families. The initial mechanical trauma is followed by a damaging secondary injury cascade involving proapoptotic signaling, ischemia, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Ongoing cellular necrosis releases ATP, DNA, glutamate, and free radicals to create a cytotoxic postinjury milieu. Long-term regeneration of lost or injured networks is further impeded by cystic cavitation and the formation of an inhibitory glial-chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan scar. In this article, we discuss important neuroprotective interventions currently applied in clinical practice, including surgical decompression, blood pressure augmentation, and i.v. methylprednisolone. We then explore exciting translational therapies on the horizon, such as riluzole, minocycline, fibroblast growth factor, magnesium, and hypothermia. Finally, we summarize the key neuroregenerative strategies of the next decade, including glial scar degradation, Rho-ROCK inhibition, cell-based therapies, and novel bioengineered adjuncts. Throughout, we emphasize the need for combinatorial approaches to this multifactorial problem and discuss relevant studies at the forefront of translation. We conclude by providing our perspectives on the future direction of SCI research.

Neuronal repair and replacement in spinal cord injury,Bareyre FM.,"AB  - Spinal cord injury typically results in permanent disability. Many studies have indicated that transplantation of several different types of stem cells promotes functional recovery in animal models of spinal cord injury. A conceptually different approach to utilize stem cells for regenerative therapies may be recruitment of endogenous neural stem cells resident in the adult spinal cord. We discuss the possibilities, risks, and mechanisms for stem cells in spinal cord repair."
From bench to beside to cure spinal cord injury: lost in translation?,"Hug A, Weidner N.","AB  - The spinal cord injury leads to enervation of normal tissue homeostasis ultimately leading to paralysis. Until now there is no proper cure for the treatment of spinal cord injury. Recently, cell therapy in animal spinal cord injury models has shown some progress of recovery. At present, clinical trials are under progress to evaluate the efficacy of cell transplantation for the treatment of spinal cord injury. Different types of cells such as pluripotent stem cells derived neural cells, mesenchymal stromal cells, neural stem cells, glial cells are being tested in various spinal cord injury models. In this review we highlight both the advances and lacuna in the field of spinal cord injury by discussing epidemiology, pathophysiology, molecular mechanism, and various cell therapy strategies employed in preclinical and clinical injury models and finally we discuss the limitations and ethical issues involved in cell therapy approach for treating spinal cord injury."
Exosomes Derived from Mesenchymal Stem Cells: Therapeutic Opportunities for Spinal Cord Injury,Zhang C.,"AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) often results in significant dysfunction and disability. A series of treatments have been proposed to prevent and overcome the formation of the glial scar and inhibitory factors to axon regrowth. In the last decade, cell therapy has emerged as a new tool for several diseases of the nervous system. Stem cells act as minipumps providing trophic and immunomodulatory factors to enhance axonal growth, to modulate the environment, and to reduce neuroinflammation. This capability can be boosted by genetical manipulation to deliver trophic molecules. Different types of stem cells have been tested, according to their properties and the therapeutic aims. They differ from each other for origin, developmental stage, stage of differentiation, and fate lineage. Related to this, stem cells differentiating into neurons could be used for cell replacement, even though the feasibility that stem cells after transplantation in the adult lesioned spinal cord can differentiate into neurons, integrate within neural circuits, and emit axons reaching the muscle is quite remote. The timing of cell therapy has been variable, and may be summarized in the acute and chronic phases of disease, when stem cells interact with a completely different environment. Even though further experimental studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of action, the therapeutic, and the side effects of cell therapy, several clinical protocols have been tested or are under trial. Here, we report the state-of-the-art of cell therapy in SCI, in terms of feasibility, outcome, and side effects."
Stem cells for the treatment of spinal cord injury,"Coutts M, Keirstead HS.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) can have a range of debilitating effects and permanently alter the capabilities and quality of life of survivors. The first specialized centers of care for SCI were established in 1944 and since then an increasing amount of research has been carried out in this area. Despite this, the present treatment and care levels for SCI are not comparable to those in other areas of medicine. In the clinic, the aim of SCI treatment is primarily to limit secondary damage by reducing compression in trauma spots and stabilizing the spinal column. Currently, no effective strategy for functional recovery is offered. In this review, we focus on research progress on the molecular mechanisms underlying SCI, and assess the treatment outcomes of SCI in animal models, i.e., neurotrophins and stem cells are discussed as pre-clinical therapies in animal models. We also assess the resources available and national research projects carried out on SCI in China in recent years, as well as making recommendations for the future allocation of funds in this area."
Neural stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles: The light of central nervous system diseases,"Li Y, Fang B.","AB  - Despite intense efforts to overcome the inhospitable milieu for axonal regeneration within the damaged spinal cord an evidence-based repair strategy promoting relevant functional improvement is still not available for spinal cord injured individuals. Nevertheless, several preclinical axonal regenerative strategies were developed all the way to phase I/II clinical trials, which have recently been terminated. The aim of this chapter is to critically review translated preclinical treatment strategies with respect to their conformity with previously published guidelines and requirements for preclinical studies leading to clinical trials in human subjects with spinal cord injury (SCI). Cell-based strategies (macrophage and embryonic stem cell grafting) and the administration of C3 transferase inhibitors and anti-Nogo-A antibodies were investigated. Overall, these four approaches comply with preclinical quality standards to varying degree. For future preclinical analyses, several additive components such as defined criteria for robustness of observed effects, a clear confirmation of underlying structural mechanisms, and the implementation of appropriate preclinical rehab approaches should be considered in order to increase the quality and consequently the likelihood of respective therapeutic strategies to succeed in human individuals suffering from SCI."
Olfactory ensheathing cells: Unique glial cells promising for treatments of spinal cord injury,"Ursavas S, Darici H, Karaoz E.","AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are considered a very promising alternative tool in cell therapies and regenerative medicine due to their ease of obtaining from various tissues and their ability to differentiate into different cell types. This manuscript provides a review of current knowledge on the use of MSC-based therapies as an alternative for certain common pathologies in dogs and cats where conventional treatments are ineffective. The aim of this review is to assist clinical veterinarians in making decisions about the suitability of each protocol from a clinical perspective, rather than focusing solely on research. MSC-based therapies have shown promising results in certain pathologies, such as spinal cord injuries, wounds, and skin and eye diseases. However, the effectiveness of these cell therapies can be influenced by a wide array of factors, leading to varying outcomes. Future research will focus on designing protocols and methodologies that allow more precise and effective MSC treatments for each case."
Are induced pluripotent stem cells the future of cell-based regenerative therapies for spinal cord injury?,"Salewski RP, Eftekharpour E, Fehlings MG.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating condition often resulting in paralysis, yet currently there is no effective treatment. Stem cell transplantation is a promising therapeutic strategy for promoting tissue repair after SCI. Stem cells offer a renewable source of cells with inherent plasticity for tissue regeneration. Neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) are multipotent cells that self-renew and are committed to the neural lineage, and thus, they are especially suited to SCI repair. NSPCs may differentiate into neural cells after transplantation into the injured spinal cord, replacing lost or damaged cells, providing trophic support, restoring connectivity, and facilitating regeneration. Here, we review experimental studies and considerations for clinical translation of NSPC transplantation for SCI."
Cell Transplantation for Repair of the Spinal Cord and Prospects for Generating Region-Specific Exogenic Neuronal Cells,"Roman A, Huntemer-Silveira A, Waldron MA, Khalid Z, Blake J, Parr AM, Low WC.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a worldwide highly crippling disease that can lead to the loss of motor and sensory neurons. Among the most promising therapies, there are new techniques of tissue engineering based on stem cells that promote neuronal regeneration. Among the different types of stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) seem the most promising. Indeed, MSCs are able to release trophic factors and to differentiate into the cell types that can be found in the spinal cord. Currently, the most common procedure to insert cells in the lesion site is infusion. However, this causes a low rate of survival and engraftment in the lesion site. For these reasons, tissue engineering is focusing on bioresorbable scaffolds to help the cells to stay in situ. Scaffolds do not only have a passive role but become fundamental for the trophic support of cells and the promotion of neuroregeneration. More and more types of materials are being studied as scaffolds to decrease inflammation and increase the engraftment as well as the survival of the cells. Our review aims to highlight how the use of scaffolds made from biomaterials enriched with MSCs gives positive results in in vivo SCI models as well as the first evidence obtained in clinical trials."
Mesenchymal Stem Cells for the Treatment of Spinal Cord Injury in Rat Models: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis,"Wang Y, Ding Y, Guo C.","AB  - A spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most devastating lesions, as it can damage the continuity and conductivity of the central nervous system, resulting in complex pathophysiology. Encouraged by the advances in nanotechnology, stem cell biology, and materials science, researchers have proposed various interdisciplinary approaches for spinal cord regeneration. In this respect, the present review aims to explore the most recent developments in SCI treatment and spinal cord repair. Specifically, it briefly describes the characteristics of SCIs, followed by an extensive discussion on newly developed nanocarriers (e.g., metal-based, polymer-based, liposomes) for spinal cord delivery, relevant biomolecules (e.g., growth factors, exosomes) for SCI treatment, innovative cell therapies, and novel natural and synthetic biomaterial scaffolds for spinal cord regeneration."
Recent advancements in stem cell and gene therapies for neurological disorders and intractable epilepsy,"Naegele JR, Maisano X, Yang J, Royston S, Ribeiro E.","AB  - During the past decade, significant advances have been made in refinements for regenerative therapies following human spinal cord injury (SCI). Positive results have been achieved with different types of cells in various clinical studies of SCI. In this review, we summarize recently-completed clinical trials using cell-mediated regenerative therapies for human SCI, together with ongoing trials using neural stem cells. Specifically, clinical studies published in Chinese journals are included. These studies show that current transplantation therapies are relatively safe, and have provided varying degrees of neurological recovery. However, many obstacles exist, hindering the introduction of a specific clinical therapy, including complications and their causes, selection of the target population, and optimization of transplantation material. Despite these and other challenges, with the collaboration of research groups and strong support from various organizations, cell-mediated regenerative therapies will open new perspectives for SCI treatment."
Restoring function after spinal cord injury: promoting spontaneous regeneration with stem cells and activity-based therapies,"Belegu V, Oudega M, Gary DS, McDonald JW.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) often induces loss of motor and/or sensory function below the level of injury. While deficits persist in complete lesions, partial lesions of the spinal cord can be followed by spontaneous functional recovery. In this review we address the mechanisms underlying spontaneous recovery in the adult CNS. We argue that the adult brain and spinal cord are able to spontaneously respond to SCI, and do so by (i) anatomically reorganizing axonal connections and (ii) generating new precursor cells. Knowledge of the endogenous recovery strategies should also provide the basis for the development of new therapeutic strategies for spinal cord injury. In this review we describe the processes of endogenous axonal repair and cell replacement in the injured spinal cord and discuss how transplantation of stem/progenitor cells could enhance these endogenous repair strategies."
Nanotechnology for treatment of stroke and spinal cord injury,"Kubinová S, Syková E.","AB  - This article reviews stem cell-based strategies for spinal cord injury repair, and practical issues concerning their translation to the clinic. Recent progress in the stem cell field includes clinically compliant culture conditions and directed differentiation of both embryonic stem cells and somatic stem cells. We provide a brief overview of the types of stem cells under evaluation, comparing their advantages and disadvantages for use in human clinical trials. We review the practical considerations and risks that must be addressed before human treatments can begin. With a growing understanding of these practical issues, stem cell biology, and spinal cord injury pathophysiology, stem cell-based therapies are moving closer to clinical application."
Transplantation of umbilical cord blood stem cells for treating spinal cord injury,"Park DH, Lee JH, Borlongan CV, Sanberg PR, Chung YG, Cho TH.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is generally the consequence of physical damage, which may result in devastating consequences such as paraplegia or paralysis. Some certain candidates for SCI repair are olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), which are unique glial cells located in the transition region of the peripheral nervous system and central nervous system and perform neuron regeneration in the olfactory system throughout life. Culture studies have clarified many properties of OECs, but their mechanisms of actions are not fully understood. Successful results achieved in animal models showcased that SCI treatment with OEC transplants is suitable for clinical trials. However, clinical trials are limited by difficulties like cell acquisition for autograft transplantation. Despite the improvements in both animal and clinical studies so far, there is still insufficient information about the mechanism of actions, adverse effects, proper application methods, effective subtypes, and sources of cells. This review summarizes pre-clinical and clinical literature focused on the cellular characterization of both OECs in vitro and post-transplantation. We highlight the roles and effects of OECs on (a) the injury-induced glial milieu, (b) neuronal growth/regeneration, and (c) functional recovery after injury. Due to the shown benefits of OECs with in vitro and animal studies and a limited number of clinical trials, where safety and effectivity were shown, it is necessary to conduct more studies on OECs to obtain effective and feasible treatment methods."
Therapeutic Potential of Niche-Specific Mesenchymal Stromal Cells for Spinal Cord Injury Repair,"Lindsay SL, Barnett SC.","AB  - Recent progress in the stem cell biology has led much insight into new therapeutic interventions aiming for the regeneration of the damaged central nervous system. The major strategies can be classified into two subgroups: (1) activation of endogenous neural stem cells, and (2) cell transplantation therapies. In either of these strategies, it is crucial to understand the underlying mechanisms of maintenance, activation, and differentiation of neural stem cells and subsequent process, including the migration, survival, and functional maturation of differentiated cells. In this paper, we would like to summarize our recent findings on the therapeutic interventions of the injured spinal cord, especially focusing on the development of treatment for the acute phase of spinal cord injury with anti-interleukin (IL)-6 receptor blocking antibody."
Neural stem cells and regeneration of injured spinal cord,"Okano H, Okada S, Nakamura M, Toyama Y.","AB  - Although neural regeneration is an active research field today, no current treatments can aid regeneration after spinal cord injury. This article reviews the feasibility of spinal cord repair and provides an overview of the range of strategies scientists are taking toward regeneration. The major focus of this article is the future role of stem cell transplantation and similar rehabilitative restorative approaches designed to optimize spontaneous regeneration by mobilizing endogenous stem cells and facilitating other cellular mechanisms of regeneration, such as axonal growth and myelination."
Dental Stem Cell in Tooth Development and Advances of Adult Dental Stem Cell in Regenerative Therapies,"Tan J, Xu X, Lin J, Fan L, Zheng Y, Kuang W.","AB  - Despite advances in medical and surgical care, current clinical therapies for spinal cord injury (SCI) are limited. During the last two decades, the search for new therapies has been revolutionized by the discovery of stem cells, inspiring scientists and clinicians to search for stem cell-based reparative approaches for many disorders, including neurotrauma. Cell-based therapies using embryonic and adult stem cells in animal models of these disorders have provided positive outcome results. However, the availability of clinically suitable cell sources for human application has been hindered by both technical and ethical issues. The recent discovery of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells holds the potential to revolutionize the field of regenerative medicine by offering the option of autologous transplantation, thus eliminating the issue of host rejection. Herein, we will provide the rationale for the use of iPS cells in SCI therapies. In this review, we will evaluate the recent advancements in the field of iPS cells including their capacity for differentiation toward neural lineages that may allow iPS cells transplantation in cell-based therapy for spinal cord repair."
Stem cells in canine spinal cord injury--promise for regenerative therapy in a large animal model of human disease,"McMahill BG, Borjesson DL, Sieber-Blum M, Nolta JA, Sturges BK.","AB  - Tissue engineering strategies have shown promise in promoting healing and regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI); however, these strategies are limited by inflammation and the immune response. Infiltration of cells of the innate and adaptive immune responses and the inflammation that follows cause secondary damage adjacent to the injury, increased scarring, and a potently inhibitory environment for the regeneration of damaged neurons. While the inflammation that ensues is typically associated with limited regeneration, the immune response is a crucial element in the closing of the blood-brain barrier, minimizing the spread of injury, and initiating healing. This review summarizes the strategies that have been developed to modulate the immune response towards an anti-inflammatory environment that is permissive to the regeneration of neurons, glia, and parenchyma. We focus on the use of biomaterials, biologically active molecules, gene therapy, nanoparticles, and stem cells to modulate the immune response, and illustrate concepts for future therapies. Current clinical treatments for SCI are limited to systemic hypothermia or methylprednisolone, which both act by systemically mitigating the effects of immune response but have marginal efficacy. Herein, we discuss emerging research strategies to further enhance these clinical treatments by directly targeting specific aspects of the immune response."
Novel Technologies to Address the Lower Motor Neuron Injury and Augment Reconstruction in Spinal Cord Injury,"Bazarek SF, Krenn MJ, Shah SB, Mandeville RM, Brown JM.","AB  - Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and is used as a first line drug in the treatment of Philadelphia-chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukaemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Being tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib modulates the activities of Abelson gene (c-Abl), Abelson related gene (ARG), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), lymphocyte-specific protein (Lck), mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain (AICD), α-synuclein and the stem-cell factor receptor (c-kit). Studies have shown the role of imatinib in modulating the pathophysiological state of a number of disorders affecting brain and spinal cord such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury. The present review discusses the role of imatinib in the above described disorders and the possible mechanisms involved in these diseases."
Functional considerations of stem cell transplantation therapy for spinal cord repair,"Enzmann GU, Benton RL, Talbott JF, Cao Q, Whittemore SR.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts the spinal cord and results in the loss of sensory and motor function below the lesion site. The treatment of SCI became a challenge because the injured neurons fail to axon regenerate and repair after injury. Promoting axonal regeneration plays a key role in the treatment strategies for SCI. It would meet the goal of reconstruction the injured spinal cord and improving the functional recovery. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are attractive therapeutic potential cell sources for SCI, and it could rebuild the injured spinal cord through neuroprotection, neural regeneration and remyelinating. Evidence has demonstrated that BMSCs play important roles in mediating axon regeneration, and glial scar formation after SCI in animal experiments and some clinical trials. We reviewed the role of BMSCs in regulating axon regeneration and glial scar formation after SCI. BMSCs based therapies may provide a therapeutic potential for the injured spinal cord by promoting axonal regeneration and repair."
Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) improved functional recovery of spinal cord injury partly by promoting axonal regeneration,"Lin L, Lin H, Bai S, Zheng L, Zhang X.","AB  - Due to the nature of the biological response to traumatic spinal cord injury, there are very limited therapeutic options available to patients. Recent advances in cell transplantation have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of transplanting supportive cell types following spinal cord injury. In particular, pluripotent stem cell derived neural cells are of interest for future investigation. Use of pluripotent stem cells as the source allows many cell types to be produced from a population that can be expanded in vitro. In this review, we will discuss the signaling pathways that have been used to differentiate spinal neural phenotypes from pluripotent stem cells. Additionally, we will highlight methods that have been developed to direct the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells to specific neural fates. Further refinement and elaboration of these techniques might aid in elucidating the multitude of neuronal subtypes endogenous to the spinal cord, as well as produce further therapeutic options for spinal cord injury recovery.

"Expanding spectrum of anticancer drug, imatinib, in the disorders affecting brain and spinal cord","Kumar M, Kulshrestha R, Singh N, Jaggi AS.","AB  - Stem cells hold great promise for therapeutic repair after spinal cord injury (SCI). This review compares the current experimental approaches taken towards a stem cell-based therapy for SCI. It critically evaluates stem cell sources, injury paradigms, and functional measurements applied to detect behavioral changes after transplantation into the spinal cord. Many of the documented improvements do not exclusively depend on lineage-specific cellular differentiation. In most of the studies, the functional tests used cannot unequivocally demonstrate how differentiation of the transplanted cells contributes to the observed effects. Standardized cell isolation and transplantation protocols could facilitate the assessment of the true contribution of various experimental parameters on recovery. We conclude that at present embryonic stem (ES)-derived cells hold the most promise for therapeutic utility, but that non-neural cells may ultimately be optimal if the mechanism of possible transdifferentiation can be elucidated."
Derivation of Specific Neural Populations From Pluripotent Cells for Understanding and Treatment of Spinal Cord Injury,"White N, Sakiyama-Elbert SE.","AB  - A wide diversity of subjects are presented at the annual American Society of Neural Therapy and Repair meeting every year, and 2013 was no exception. An insight into the current research trends in regenerative medicine was provided, including studies to elucidate disease mechanisms and the means to treat them. Different methods featured in 2013 included stem cell and tissue transplantation, gene therapy, dietary supplementation, and hydrogels as scaffold systems for the growth of stem cells. Diseases ranged from Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury, and stroke to traumatic brain injury, pain, and epilepsy. Traumatic brain injury was an increasingly popular topic, highlighting the concerns of soldiers returning from duty overseas. A number of studies looked at ways to treat or elucidate mechanisms for more than one disorder. The studies including stem cells predominantly involved human-derived cells being transplanted, and the most common recipient of stem cells were rodents. Only one autologous transplant study, which featured mouse bone marrow cells being transplanted into mice for the treatment of stroke, was presented this year. The most popular stem cell studied was the neural stem cell, which in some instances was predifferentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells or embryonic stem cells. Other stem cells included the mesenchymal stem cell and adipose, amniotic fluid, and umbilical cord blood-derived cells. Many studies also looked at more than one stem cell type. Combinational studies, such as gene therapy and transplantation, were also commonly explored as well as studies using fetal ventral mesencephalon or spinal cord tissue rather than stem cells. Numerous studies also featured the use of drugs""-some naturally derived or naturally occurring as well as drug cocktails. A number of possible treatments"
Regenerative medicine for the treatment of spinal cord injury: more than just promises?,"Pêgo AP, Kubinova S, Cizkova D, Vanicky I, Mar FM, Sousa MM, Sykova E.","AB  - The potential applications of stem cell therapies for treating neurological disorders are enormous. Many laboratories are focusing on stem cell treatments for CNS diseases, including spinal cord injury, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and epilepsy. Among the many stem cell types under testing for neurological treatments, the most common are fetal and adult brain stem cells, embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, and mesenchymal stem cells. An expanding toolbox of molecular probes is now available to allow analyses of neural stem cell fates prior to and after transplantation. Concomitantly, protocols are being developed to direct the fates of stem cell-derived neural progenitors, and also to screen stem cells for tumorigenicity and aneuploidy. The rapid progress in the field suggests that novel stem cell and gene therapies for neurological disorders are in the pipeline."
Mesenchymal autologous stem cells,"Falavigna A, da Costa JC.","AB  - The use of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) for transplant-mediated repair represents an important and promising therapeutic strategy after spinal cord injury (SCI). The appeal of MSCs has been fuelled by their ease of isolation, immunosuppressive properties, and low immunogenicity, alongside the large variety of available tissue sources. However, despite reported similarities in vitro, MSCs sourced from distinct tissues may not have comparable biological properties in vivo. There is accumulating evidence that stemness, plasticity, immunogenicity, and adaptability of stem cells is largely controlled by tissue niche. The extrinsic impact of cellular niche for MSC repair potential is therefore important, not least because of its impact on ex vivo expansion for therapeutic purposes. It is likely certain niche-targeted MSCs are more suited for SCI transplant-mediated repair due to their intrinsic capabilities, such as inherent neurogenic properties. In addition, the various MSC anatomical locations means that differences in harvest and culture procedures can make cross-comparison of pre-clinical data difficult. Since a clinical grade MSC product is inextricably linked with its manufacture, it is imperative that cells can be made relatively easily using appropriate materials. We discuss these issues and highlight the importance of identifying the appropriate niche-specific MSC type for SCI repair."
Stem Cell Therapies: Opportunities for Ensuring the Quality and Safety of Clinical Offerings: Summary of a Joint Workshop,Board on Health Sciences Policy; Board on Life Sciences; Division on Earth and Life Studies; Institute of Medicine; National Academy of Sciences.,"AB  - Spinal cord injury triggers a complex set of events that lead to tissue healing without the restoration of normal function due to the poor regenerative capacity of the spinal cord. Nevertheless, current knowledge about the intrinsic regenerative ability of central nervous system axons, when in a supportive environment, has made the prospect of treating spinal cord injury a reality. Among the range of strategies under investigation, cell-based therapies offer the most promising results, due to the multifactorial roles that these cells can fulfil. However, the best cell source is still a matter of debate, as are clinical issues that include the optimal cell dose as well as the timing and route of administration. In this context, the role of biomaterials is gaining importance. These can not only act as vehicles for the administered cells but also, in the case of chronic lesions, can be used to fill the permanent cyst, thus creating a more favourable and conducive environment for axonal regeneration in addition to serving as local delivery systems of therapeutic agents to improve the regenerative milieu. Some of the candidate molecules for the future are discussed in view of the knowledge derived from studying the mechanisms that facilitate the intrinsic regenerative capacity of central nervous system neurons. The future challenge for the multidisciplinary teams working in the field is to translate the knowledge acquired in basic research into effective combinatorial therapies to be applied in the clinic."
"Emerging repair, regeneration, and translational research advances for spinal cord injury","Kwon BK, Sekhon LH, Fehlings MG.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) develops primary and secondary damage to neural tissue and this often results in permanent disability of the motor and sensory functions. However, there is currently no effective treatment except methylprednisolone, and the use of methylprednisolone has also been questioned due to its moderate efficacy and the drug's downside. Regenerative medicine has remarkably developed since the discovery of stem cells, and many studies have suggested the potential of cell-based therapies for neural injury. Especially, the therapeutic potential of human umbilical cord blood cells (hUCB cells) for intractable neurological disorders has been demonstrated using in vitro and vivo models. The hUCB cells are immune naïve and they are able to differentiate into other phenotypes, including the neural lineage. Their ability to produce several neurotropic factors and to modulate immune and inflammatory reactions has also been noted. Recent evidence has emerged suggesting alternative pathways of graft-mediated neural repair that involve neurotrophic effects. These effects are caused by the release of various growth factors that promote cell survival, angiogenesis and anti-inflammation, and this is all aside from a cell replacement mechanism. In this review, we present the recent findings on the stemness properties and the therapeutic potential of hUCB as a safe, feasible and effective cellular source for transplantation in SCI. These multifaceted protective and restorative effects from hUCB grafts may be interdependent and they act in harmony to promote therapeutic benefits for SCI. Nevertheless, clinical studies with hUCB are still rare because of the concerns about safety and efficiency. Among these concerns, the major histocompatibility in allogeneic transplantation is an important issue to be addressed in future clinical trials for treating SCI."
A clinical perspective of spinal cord injury,"Nandoe Tewarie RD, Hurtado A, Bartels RH, Grotenhuis JA, Oudega M.","AB  - The use of cell-based therapies for spinal cord injuries has recently gained prominence as a potential therapy or component of a combination strategy. Experimental and clinical studies have been performed using mesenchymal stem cell therapy to treat spinal cord injuries with encouraging results. However, there have been reports on the adverse effects of these stem cell-based therapies, especially in the context of tumor modulation. This article surveys the literature relevant to the potential of mesenchymal autologous stem cells for spinal cord injuries and their clinical implications."
Current status of experimental cell replacement approaches to spinal cord injury,"Eftekharpour E, Karimi-Abdolrezaee S, Fehlings MG.","AB  - The use of nanotechnology in cell therapy and tissue engineering offers promising future perspectives for brain and spinal cord injury treatment. Stem cells have been shown to selectively target injured brain and spinal cord tissue and improve functional recovery. To allow cell detection, superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles can be used to label transplanted cells. MRI is then a suitable method for the in vivo tracking of grafted cells in the host organism. CNS, and particularly spinal cord, injury is accompanied by tissue damage and the formation of physical and biochemical barriers that prevent axons from regenerating. One aspect of nanomedicine is the development of biologically compatible nanofiber scaffolds that mimic the structure of the extracellular matrix and can serve as a permissive bridge for axonal regeneration or as a drug-delivery system. The incorporation of biologically active epitopes and/or the utilization of these scaffolds as stem cell carriers may further enhance their therapeutic efficacy."
A combination of mesenchymal stem cells and scaffolds promotes motor functional recovery in spinal cord injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Yousefifard M, Nasseri Maleki S, Askarian-Amiri S, Vaccaro AR, Chapman JR, Fehlings MG, Hosseini M, Rahimi-Movaghar V.","AB  - Stem cell-based therapies are considered as a promising treatment for many clinical usage such as tooth regeneration, bone repairation, spinal cord injury, and so on. However, the ideal stem cell for stem cell-based therapy still remains to be elucidated. In the past decades, several types of stem cells have been isolated from teeth, including dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED), periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs), dental follicle progenitor stem cells (DFPCs) and stem cells from apical papilla (SCAP), which may be a good source for stem cell-based therapy in certain disease, especially when they origin from neural crest is considered. In this review, the specific characteristics and advantages of the adult dental stem cell population will be summarized and the molecular mechanisms of the differentiation of dental stem cell during tooth development will be also discussed."
Concise review: human pluripotent stem cells in the treatment of spinal cord injury,"Lukovic D, Moreno Manzano V, Stojkovic M, Bhattacharya SS, Erceg S.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a relatively common and lethal dangerous disease of the central nervous system, for which there is a lack of effective clinical treatments. It has been found that mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (MSC-Exos) play a key role in alleviating SCI through mechanisms such as regulating the microenvironment, promoting angiogenesis, and facilitating axonal regeneration. However, the drawbacks of natural exosomes, such as low yield, weak activity, and low targeting ability, limit their clinical applications. In recent years, MSCs-Exos have gradually become a research hotspot for treating SCI through miRNA modulation, combined hydrogel, and preculture. In addition, exosomes as good biocompatible drugs, nucleic acid, and other delivery carriers have shown a broad application prospect in treating SCI. This article summarizes the pathogenesis of SCI and the research progress of MSC-Exos in the treatment of SCI in recent years, and provides a systematic review of the mechanisms of MSC exosomes and their combination with different modalities in the treatment of SCI."
Adult-derived pluripotent stem cells,"Faulkner SD, Vawda R, Fehlings MG.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in neural loss and consequently motor and sensory impairment below the injury. There are currently no effective therapies for the treatment of traumatic SCI in humans. Different kinds of cells including embryonic, fetal, and adult stem cells have been transplanted into animal models of SCI resulting in sensorimotor benefits. Transplantation of human embryonic stem cell (hESC)- or induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neural cells is nowadays a promising therapy for SCI. This review updates the recent progress in preclinical studies and discusses the advantages and flaws of various neural cell types derived from hESCs and hiPSCs. Before introducing the stem cell replacement strategies in clinical practice, this complex field needs to advance significantly in understanding the lesion itself, the animal model adequacy, and improve cell replacement source. This knowledge will contribute to the successful translation from animals to humans and lead to established guidelines for rigorous safety screening in order to be implemented in clinical practice."
The potential therapeutic roles of dental pulp stem cells in spinal cord injury,"Fu J, Li W, Mao T, Chen Z, Lai L, Lin J, Nie Z, Sun Y, Chen Y, Zhang Q, Li X.","AB  - The use of cell transplantation for spinal cord injury is a rapidly evolving field in regenerative medicine. Numerous animal models are currently being used. However, translation to human patients is still a challenging step. Dogs are of increasing importance as a translational model for human disease since there is a greater awareness of the need to increase the quality of preclinical data. The use of dogs ultimately brings benefit to both human and veterinary medicine. In this review we analyze experimental and clinical studies using cell transplantation for canine spinal cord injury. Overall, in experimental studies, transplantation groups showed improvement over control groups. Improvements were measured at the functional, electrophysiological, histological, RNA and protein levels. Most clinical studies support beneficial effects of cell transplantation despite the fact that methodological limitations preclude definitive conclusions. However, the mechanisms of action and underlying the behavior of transplanted cells in the injured spinal cord remain unclear. Overall, we conclude here that stem cell interventions are a promising avenue for the treatment of spinal cord injury. Canines are a promising model that may help bridge the gap between translational research and human clinical trials."
Non-surgical management of spinal cord injury,"Legos JJ, Gopez JJ, Young WF.","AB  - Despite advances in medical and surgical care, the current clinical therapies for spinal cord injury (SCI) are largely ineffective. During the last 2 decades, the search for new therapies has been revolutionized by the discovery of stem cells, which has inspired scientists and clinicians to search for a stem cell-based reparative approaches to many diseases, including neurotrauma. In the present study, the authors briefly summarize current knowledge related to the pathophysiology of SCI, including the concepts of primary and secondary injury and the importance of posttraumatic demyelination. Key inhibitory obstacles that impede axonal regeneration include the glial scar and a number of myelin inhibitory molecules including Nogo. Recent advancements in cell replacement therapy as a therapeutic strategy for SCI are summarized. The strategies include the use of pluripotent human stem cells, embryonic stem cells, and a number of adult-derived stem and progenitor cells such as mesenchymal stem cells, Schwann cells, olfactory ensheathing cells, and adult-derived neural precursor cells. Although current strategies to repair the subacutely injured cord appear promising, many obstacles continue to render the treatment of chronic injuries challenging. Nonetheless, the future for stem cell-based reparative strategies for treating SCI appears bright."
Biocompatible hydrogels in spinal cord injury repair,"Hejcl A, Lesný P, Prádný M, Michálek J, Jendelová P, Stulík J, Syková E.","AB  - Spinal cord injury remains a devastating neurological condition with limited therapeutic opportunities. Since decompressive surgery and high-dose methylprednisolone have limited utility for most patients, spinal cord injury clearly represents a major medical challenge. Experimental evidence has suggested that secondary cellular injury processes may be a realistic target for therapeutic intervention with the goal of inhibiting the progression of detrimental changes that normally follows traumatic injury to the cord. Preventing or reducing this delayed cellular injury may alone improve neurological recovery or facilitate future regenerative approaches to the injured cord. This review summarises recent advances in the development of pharmacological agents targeting the acute phase of spinal cord injury as well as potential strategies to facilitate regeneration of the spinal cord."
Cell and molecular approaches to the attenuation of pain after spinal cord injury,Eaton MJ.,"AB  - Although there are challenges in treating traumatic central nervous system diseases, mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) have recently proven to be a promising non-cellular therapy. We comprehensively evaluated the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles in traumatic central nervous system diseases in this meta-analysis based on preclinical studies. Our meta-analysis was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42022327904, May 24, 2022). To fully retrieve the most relevant articles, the following databases were thoroughly searched: PubMed, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, and Ovid-Embase (up to April 1, 2022). The included studies were preclinical studies of mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles for traumatic central nervous system diseases. The Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (SYRCLE)'s risk of bias tool was used to examine the risk of publication bias in animal studies. After screening 2347 studies, 60 studies were included in this study. A meta-analysis was conducted for spinal cord injury (n = 52) and traumatic brain injury (n = 8). The results indicated that mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles treatment prominently promoted motor function recovery in spinal cord injury animals, including rat Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan locomotor rating scale scores (standardized mean difference [SMD]: 2.36, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.96-2.76, P < 0.01, I(2) = 71%) and mouse Basso Mouse Scale scores (SMD = 2.31, 95% CI: 1.57-3.04, P = 0.01, I(2) = 60%) compared with controls. Further, mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles treatment significantly promoted neurological recovery in traumatic brain injury animals, including the modified Neurological Severity Score (SMD = -4.48, 95% CI: -6.12 to -2.84, P < 0.01, I(2) = 79%) and Foot Fault Test (SMD = -3.26, 95% CI: -4.09 to -2.42, P = 0.28, I(2) = 21%) compared with controls. Subgroup analyses showed that characteristics may be related to the therapeutic effect of mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles. For Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan locomotor rating scale scores, the efficacy of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles was higher than that of xenogeneic mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (allogeneic: SMD = 2.54, 95% CI: 2.05-3.02, P = 0.0116, I(2) = 65.5%; xenogeneic: SMD: 1.78, 95%CI: 1.1-2.45, P = 0.0116, I(2) = 74.6%). Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles separated by ultrafiltration centrifugation combined with density gradient ultracentrifugation (SMD = 3.58, 95% CI: 2.62-4.53, P < 0.0001, I(2) = 31%) may be more effective than other EV isolation methods. For mouse Basso Mouse Scale scores, placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles worked better than bone mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (placenta: SMD = 5.25, 95% CI: 2.45-8.06, P = 0.0421, I(2) = 0%; bone marrow: SMD = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.23-2.41, P = 0.0421, I(2) = 0%). For modified Neurological Severity Score, bone marrow-derived MSC-EVs worked better than adipose-derived MSC-EVs (bone marrow: SMD = -4.86, 95% CI: -6.66 to -3.06, P = 0.0306, I(2) = 81%; adipose: SMD = -2.37, 95% CI: -3.73 to -1.01, P = 0.0306, I(2) = 0%). Intravenous administration (SMD = -5.47, 95% CI: -6.98 to -3.97, P = 0.0002, I(2) = 53.3%) and dose of administration equal to 100 μg (SMD = -5.47, 95% CI: -6.98 to -3.97, P < 0.0001, I(2) = 53.3%) showed better results than other administration routes and doses. The heterogeneity of studies was small, and sensitivity analysis also indicated stable results. Last, the methodological quality of all trials was mostly satisfactory. In conclusion, in the treatment of traumatic central nervous system diseases, mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles may play a crucial role in promoting motor function recovery."
Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles therapy in traumatic central nervous system diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Yang Z, Liang Z, Rao J, Lin F, Lin Y, Xu X, Wang C, Chen C.","AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is controversy about the role of scaffolds as an adjunctive therapy to mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation in spinal cord injury (SCI). Thus, the authors aimed to design a meta-analysis on preclinical evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of combination therapy of scaffold + MSC transplantation in comparison with scaffolds alone and MSCs alone in improving motor dysfunction in SCI. METHODS: Electronic databases including Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched from inception until the end of August 2018. Two independent reviewers screened related experimental studies. Animal studies that evaluated the effectiveness of scaffolds and/or MSCs on motor function recovery following experimental SCI were included. The findings were reported as standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: A total of 34 articles were included in the meta-analysis. Analyses show that combination therapy in comparison with the scaffold group alone (SMD 2.00, 95% CI 1.53-2.46, p < 0.0001), the MSCs alone (SMD 1.58, 95% CI 0.84-2.31, p < 0.0001), and the nontreated group (SMD 3.52, 95% CI 2.84-4.20, p < 0.0001) significantly improved motor function recovery. Co-administration of MSCs + scaffolds only in the acute phase of injury (during the first 3 days after injury) leads to a significant recovery compared to scaffold alone (SMD 2.18, p < 0.0001). In addition, the cotransplantation of scaffolds with bone marrow-derived MSCs (SMD 1.99, p < 0.0001) and umbilical cord-derived MSCs (SMD 1.50, p = 0.001) also improved motor function following SCI. CONCLUSIONS: The findings showed that scaffolds + MSCs is more effective than scaffolds and MSCs alone in improving motor function following SCI in animal models, when used in the acute phase of injury."
Stem Cells in the Treatment of Spinal Cord Injury: A Review of Currently Registered Clinical Trials,"Abraham M, Shalom M, Gold J, Seaton M, Maleski Smith A, Gendreau J, Brandel MG, Ciacci J.","AB  - Recent experimental research to treat spinal cord injury (SCI) pain has greatly increased our understanding of how such chronic pain might be modulated in the human population. Neuropathic pain is caused by the structural and biochemical changes associated with the peripheral and central nervous system damage associated with nervous system trauma, often leading to an imbalance in endogenous excitatory and inhibitory spinal systems that modulate sensory processing. But current pharmacological therapies are often ineffective over time for the greater number of patients. Although there are a variety of useful surgical and pharmacologic interventions (including electric stimulation, implantable mechanical pumps and a myriad of drugs for pain relief) cell and molecular technologies are a new frontier in pain medicine. These other potential therapeutic agents of pain are based on current and developing treatment strategies elucidated from recent research, especially concerning central spinal sensitization, and the spinal mechanisms that are thought to be the origin and ongoing cause of chronic pain, even when the injury is peripheral in location. Newly developing translational strategies such as molecular agents, viral-mediated gene transfer or cellular transplants to treat chronic pain are being evaluated in a variety of peripheral and central injury models. They seek to address both the causes of neuropathic pain, to interfere with its development and maintenance over time, and give the injured person with pain an improved quality-of-life that allows them to better deal with the larger tasks of daily life and the strenuous rehabilitation that might also improve motor function after SCI."
Role of physiotherapy in the mobilization of patients with spinal cord injury undergoing human embryonic stem cells transplantation,"Shroff G, Thakur D, Dhingra V, Baroli DS, Khatri D, Gautam RD.","AB  - Stem cells offer tremendous promise for advancing health and medicine. Whether being used to replace damaged cells and organs or else by supporting the body's intrinsic repair mechanisms, stem cells hold the potential to treat such debilitating conditions as Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and spinal cord injury. Clinical trials of stem cell treatments are under way in countries around the world, but the evidence base to support the medical use of stem cells remains limited. Despite this paucity of clinical evidence, consumer demand for treatments using stem cells has risen, driven in part by a lack of available treatment options for debilitating diseases as well as direct-to-consumer advertising and public portrayals of stem cell-based treatments. Clinics that offer stem cell therapies for a wide range of diseases and conditions have been established throughout the world, both in newly industrialized countries such as China, India, and Mexico and in developed countries such as the United States and various European nations. Though these therapies are often promoted as being established and effective, they generally have not received stringent regulatory oversight and have not been tested with rigorous trials designed to determine their safety and likely benefits. In the absence of substantiated claims, the potential for harm to patients - as well as to the field of stem cell research in general - may outweigh the potential benefits. To explore these issues, the Institute of Medicine, the National Academy of Sciences, and the International Society for Stem Cell Research held a workshop in November 2013. Stem Cell Therapies summarizes the workshop. Researchers, clinicians, patients, policy makers, and others from North America, Europe, and Asia met to examine the global pattern of treatments and products being offered, the range of patient experiences, and options to maximize the well-being of patients, either by protecting them from treatments that are dangerous or ineffective or by steering them toward treatments that are effective. This report discusses the current environment in which patients are receiving unregulated stem cell offerings, focusing on the treatments being offered and their risks and benefits. The report considers the evidence base for clinical application of stem cell technologies and ways to assure the quality of stem cell offerings."

Complement and spinal cord injury: traditional and non-traditional aspects of complement cascade function in the injured spinal cord microenvironment,"Peterson SL, Anderson AJ.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in loss of nervous tissue in the spinal cord and consequently loss of motor and sensory function. The impairments are permanent because endogenous repair events fail to restore the damaged axonal circuits that are involved in function. There is no treatment available that restores the injury-induced loss of function. The consequences of SCI are devastating physically and socially. The assessment of functional loss after SCI has been standardized in the larger part of the world. For medical care however there are no standards available. During the early phase, treatments that stabilize the patient's health and attempt to limit further neurological deterioration need to be implemented. During the later phase of SCI, the focus needs to be on prevention and/or treatment of secondary complications such as pain, pressure ulcers, and infections. Neuroprotective, axon growth-promoting and rehabilitative repair approaches are currently being tested but, so far, none of these has emerged as an effective treatment that reverses the consequences of SCI. Promising new repair approaches have emerged from the laboratory during the last years and entered the clinical arena including stem cell transplantation and functional electrical stimulation."
Mesenchymal stem cells improve locomotor recovery in traumatic spinal cord injury: systematic review with meta-analyses of rat models,"Oliveri RS, Bello S, Biering-Sørensen F.","AB  - Companion animals in veterinary medicine develop multiple naturally occurring diseases analogous to human conditions. We previously reported a comprehensive review on the feasibility, safety, and biologic activity of using novel stem cell therapies to treat a variety of inflammatory conditions in dogs and cats (2008-2015) [Hoffman AM, Dow SW. Concise review: stem cell trials using companion animal disease models. Stem Cells. 2016;34(7):1709-1729. https://doi.org/10.1002/stem.2377]. The purpose of this review is to provide an updated summary of current studies in companion animal disease models that have evaluated stem cell therapeutics that are relevant to human disease. Here we have reviewed the literature from 2015 to 2023 for publications on stem cell therapies that have been evaluated in companion animals, including dogs, cats, and horses. The review excluded case reports or studies performed in experimentally induced models of disease, studies involving cancer, or studies in purpose-bred laboratory species such as rodents. We identified 45 manuscripts meeting these criteria, an increase from 19 that were described in the previous review [Hoffman AM, Dow SW. Concise review: stem cell trials using companion animal disease models. Stem Cells. 2016;34(7):1709-1729. https://doi.org/10.1002/stem.2377]. The majority of studies were performed in dogs (n = 28), with additional studies in horses (n = 9) and cats (n = 8). Disease models included those related to musculoskeletal disease (osteoarthritis and tendon/ligament injury), neurologic disease (canine cognitive dysfunction, intervertebral disc disease, spinal cord injury) gingival/dental disease (gingivostomatitis), dermatologic disease (atopic dermatitis), chronic multi-drug resistant infections, ophthalmic disease (keratoconjunctivitis sicca, eosinophilic keratitis, immune-mediated keratitis), cardiopulmonary disease (asthma, degenerative valve disease, dilated cardiomyopathy), gastrointestinal disease (inflammatory bowel disease, chronic enteropathy), and renal disease (chronic kidney disease). The majority of studies reported beneficial responses to stem cell treatment, with the exception of those related to more chronic processes such as spinal cord injury and chronic kidney disease. However, it should also be noted that 22 studies were open-label, baseline-controlled trials and only 12 studies were randomized and controlled, making overall study interpretation difficult. As noted in the previous review, improved regulatory oversight and consistency in manufacturing of stem cell therapies are needed. Enhanced understanding of the temporal course of disease processes using advanced-omics approaches may further inform mechanisms of action and help define appropriate timing of interventions. Future directions of stem-cell-based therapies could include use of stem-cell-derived extracellular vesicles, or cell conditioning approaches to direct cells to specific pathways that are tailored to individual disease processes and stages of illness."

TSCI with Concurrent TBI: Pathophysiological Interaction and Impact on MSC Treatment,"Köhli P, Otto E, Jahn D, Reisener MJ, Appelt J, Rahmani A, Taheri N, Keller J, Pumberger M, Tsitsilonis S.","AB  - Regenerative medicine as a background of stem cell research and therapy has a long history. A wide variety of diseases including Parkinson's disease, heart diseases, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, diabetes mellitus and etc. are candidate to be treated using different types of stem cells. There are several sources of stem cells such as bone marrow, umbilical cord, peripheral blood, germ cells and the embryo/fetus tissues. Fetal stem cells (FSCs) and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have been described as the most potent stem cell source. Although their pluri- or multipotent properties leads to promising reports for their clinical applications, owning to some ethical and legal obstacles in different communities such as Muslim countries, care should be taken for therapeutic applications of FSCs and ESCs. Derivation of these cell types needs termination of pregnancy and embryo or fetus life that is prohibited according to almost all rules and teaches in Muslim communities. Abortion and termination of pregnancy under a normal condition for the procurement of stem cell materials is forbidden by nearly all the major world religions such as Islam. Legislated laws in the most of Muslim countries permit termination of pregnancy and abortion only when the life of the mother is severely threatened or when continuing pregnancy may lead to the birth of a mentally retarded, genetically or anatomically malformed child. Based on the rules and conditions in Islamic countries, finding an alternative and biologically normal source for embryonic or fetal stem cell isolation will be too difficult. On the one hand, Muslim scientists have the feasibility for finding of genetically and anatomically normal embryonic or fetal stem cell sources for research or therapy, but on the other hand they should adhere to the law and related regional and local rules in all parts of their investigation. The authors suggest that the utilization of ectopic pregnancy (EP) conceptus, extra-embryonic tissues, and therapeutic abortion materials as a valuable source of stem cells for research and medical purposes can overcome limitations associated with finding the appropriate stem cell source. Pregnancy termination because of the mentioned subjects is accepted by almost all Islamic laws because of maternal lifesaving. Also, there are no ethical or legal obstacles in the use of extra-embryonic or EP derived tissues which lead to candidate FSCs as a valuable source for stem cell researches and therapeutic applications."

The first stem/stromal cell clinical trial for spina bifida is currently underway (NCT04652908). The trial uses early gestational placental-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (PMSCs) during the fetal repair of myelomeningocele. PMSCs have been shown to exhibit unique neuroprotective, angiogenic, and antioxidant properties, all which are promising applications for SCI. This review will summarize the unique properties and current applications of PMSCs and discuss their therapeutic role for acquired SCI."

In the ongoing research to apply stem cell therapy to neurological diseases, the capacity to harness the multipotential ability of endogenous stem cell populations has become apparent. Such cell populations proliferate in response to a variety of injury states in the CNS, but in the absence of a supportive microenvironment they contribute little to any significant behavioral recovery. In the authors' laboratory and elsewhere, recent research on the regenerative potential of these stem cells in disease states such as spinal cord injury has demonstrated that the cells' proliferative potential may be greatly upregulated in response to appropriate growth signals and exogenously applied trophic factors. Further understanding of the potential of such multipotent cells and the mechanisms responsible for creating a favorable microenvironment for them may lead to additional therapeutic alternatives in the setting of neurological diseases. These therapies would require no exogenous stem cell sources and thus would avoid the ethical and moral considerations regarding their use. In this review the authors provide a brief overview of the enhancement of endogenous stem cell proliferation following neurological insult."
"Neurotrophic factors, gene therapy, and neural stem cells for spinal cord repair","Blesch A, Lu P, Tuszynski MH.","AB  - BACKGROUND: The major complication faced by patients with chronic static spinal cord injury (SCI) is the loss of mobilization. With the aim to rehabilitate SCI patients, physiotherapy is performed worldwide. However, it only helps the patients to live with their disabilities. An interdisciplinary management involving human embryonic stem cell (hESC) therapy along with physiotherapy as a supportive therapy offers regenerative treatment of the patients with SCI. MAIN BODY: The present study focuses on the role of physiotherapy in the mobilization of patients with SCI (paraplegic 136; tetraplegics 90) undergoing hESC therapy. At admission, patients were assessed on the basis of clinical and American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS), where 153, 32, 36 and 5 patients were designated with AIS score A, B, C and D, respectively. After 8-12 weeks of hESC therapy and physiotherapy, the patients showed clinical and scoring improvement. The patients with AIS score A shifted to B (15.0 %) and C (37.3 %), whereas, patients with grade B moved to C (40.6 %) and D (3.1 %). Patients with AIS score C and D shifted to grade D (13.9 %) and E (60.0 %), respectively. Moreover, orthotic devices were reduced to simpler ones. CONCLUSION: The physiotherapy aided in training of cells and took care of atrophy of limbs, whereas hESC therapy resulted in an overall improvement of the patients with SCI."
Therapeutic abortion and ectopic pregnancy: alternative sources for fetal stem cell research and therapy in Iran as an Islamic country,"Goodarzi P, Falahzadeh K, Aghayan H, Payab M, Larijani B, Alavi-Moghadam S, Tayanloo-Beik A, Adibi H, Gilany K, Arjmand B.","AB  - Traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI), commonly caused by high energy trauma in young active patients, is frequently accompanied by traumatic brain injury (TBI). Although combined trauma results in inferior clinical outcomes and a higher mortality rate, the understanding of the pathophysiological interaction of co-occurring TSCI and TBI remains limited. This review provides a detailed overview of the local and systemic alterations due to TSCI and TBI, which severely affect the autonomic and sensory nervous system, immune response, the blood-brain and spinal cord barrier, local perfusion, endocrine homeostasis, posttraumatic metabolism, and circadian rhythm. Because currently developed mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapeutic strategies for TSCI provide only mild benefit, this review raises awareness of the impact of TSCI-TBI interaction on TSCI pathophysiology and MSC treatment. Therefore, we propose that unravelling the underlying pathophysiology of TSCI with concomitant TBI will reveal promising pharmacological targets and therapeutic strategies for regenerative therapies, further improving MSC therapy."
[Current status and perspective on regenerative medicine for spinal cord injury using iPS cell],"Nakamura M, Toyama Y, Okano H.",AB  - Several experimental strategies have been employed to minimize tissue damage and to enhance axonal growth and regeneration after spinal cord injury. The transplantation of suitable cell types to provide an axonal growth substrate and the application of growth factors have been shown to augment morphological and sometimes functional recovery. In this review we discuss the use of neural stem cell transplants and neurotrophic factor delivery by gene therapy to improve axonal regeneration in animal models of spinal cord injury.
Clinical trials for the treatment of spinal cord injury: not so simple,"Mackay-Sim A, Féron F.","AB  - In the CNS, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglias are involved in not only development but also pathology such as spinal cord injury (SCI). Glial cells play dual roles (negative vs. positive effects) in these processes. After SCI, detrimental effects usually dominate and significantly retard functional recovery, and curbing these effects is critical for promoting neurological improvement. Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) represent a new therapeutic approach for SCI by enabling improved sensory and motor functions in animal models. Although transdifferentiation to spinal neurons was poor, because of their pleiotropic nature, the protective effects of BMSCs are broad and are primarily mediated through modulation of transdifferentiation into host spinal glial components. Transplantation of BMSCs can positively alter the spinal microenvironment and enhance recovery. The objective of this review is to discuss these and other related mechanisms. Since BMSCs transplantation has been applied in other clinical fields, we hope to provide useful clues for the clinical application of BMSCs to treat the SCI in the near future."
Endogenous stem cell proliferation after central nervous system injury: alternative therapeutic options,"Bambakidis NC, Theodore N, Nakaji P, Harvey A, Sonntag VK, Preul MC, Miller RH.","AB  - The inhibitory environment that surrounds the lesion site and the lack of intrinsic regenerative capacity of the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) impede the regrowth of injured axons and thereby the reestablishment of neural circuits required for functional recovery after spinal cord injuries (SCI). To circumvent these barriers, biomaterial scaffolds are applied to bridge the lesion gaps for the regrowing axons to follow, and, often by combining stem cell transplantation, to enable the local environment in the growth-supportive direction. Manipulations, such as the modulation of PTEN/mTOR pathways, can also enhance intrinsic CNS axon regrowth after injury. Given the complex pathophysiology of SCI, combining biomaterial scaffolds and genetic manipulation may provide synergistic effects and promote maximal axonal regrowth. Future directions will primarily focus on the translatability of these approaches and promote therapeutic avenues toward the functional rehabilitation of patients with SCIs."
Multifaceted neuro-regenerative activities of human dental pulp stem cells for functional recovery after spinal cord injury,"Yamamoto A, Sakai K, Matsubara K, Kano F, Ueda M.","AB  - The pathology associated with spinal cord injury (SCI) is caused not only by primary mechanical trauma, but also by secondary responses of the injured CNS. The inflammatory response to SCI is robust and plays an important but complex role in the progression of many secondary injury-associated pathways. Although recent studies have begun to dissect the beneficial and detrimental roles for inflammatory cells and proteins after SCI, many of these neuroimmune interactions are debated, not well understood, or completely unexplored. In this regard, the complement cascade is a key component of the inflammatory response to SCI, but is largely underappreciated, and our understanding of its diverse interactions and effects in this pathological environment is limited. In this review, we discuss complement in the context of SCI, first in relation to traditional functions for complement cascade activation, and then in relation to novel roles for complement proteins in a variety of models."

Combination of biomaterial transplantation and genetic enhancement of intrinsic growth capacities to promote CNS axon regeneration after spinal cord injury,"Yu B, Gu X.","AB  - Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating event with huge personal and societal costs. A limited number of treatments exist to ameliorate the progressive secondary damage that rapidly follows the primary mechanical impact. Mesenchymal stem or stromal cells (MSCs) have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and may thus reduce secondary damage after administration. We performed a systematic review with quantitative syntheses to assess the evidence of MSCs versus controls for locomotor recovery in rat models of traumatic SCI, and identified 83 eligible controlled studies comprising a total of 1,568 rats. Between-study heterogeneity was large. Fifty-three studies (64%) were reported as randomised, but only four reported adequate methodologies for randomisation. Forty-eight studies (58%) reported the use of a blinded outcome assessment. A random-effects meta-analysis yielded a difference in behavioural Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor score means of 3.9 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.2 to 4.7; P<0.001) in favour of MSCs. Trial sequential analysis confirmed the findings of the meta-analyses with the upper monitoring boundary for benefit being crossed by the cumulative Z-curve before reaching the diversity-adjusted required information size. Only time from intervention to last follow-up remained statistically significant after adjustment using multivariate random-effects meta-regression modelling. Lack of other demonstrable explanatory variables could be due to insufficient meta-analytic study power. MSCs would seem to demonstrate a substantial beneficial effect on locomotor recovery in a widely-used animal model of traumatic SCI. However, the animal results should be interpreted with caution concerning the internal and external validity of the studies in relation to the design of future clinical trials."
Physical activity-mediated functional recovery after spinal cord injury: potential roles of neural stem cells,"Teng YD, Liao WL, Choi H, Konya D, Sabharwal S, Langer R, Sidman RL, Snyder EY, Frontera WR.","AB  - As data elucidating the complexity of spinal cord injury pathophysiology emerge, it is increasingly being recognized that successful repair will probably require a multifaceted approach that combines tactics from various biomedical disciplines, including pharmacology, cell transplantation, gene therapy and material sciences. Recently, new evidence highlighting the benefit of physical activity and rehabilitation interventions during the post-injury phase has provided novel possibilities in realizing effective repair after spinal cord injury. However, before a comprehensive therapeutic strategy that optimally utilizes the benefits of each of these disciplines can be designed, the basic mechanisms by which these various interventions act must be thoroughly explored and important synergistic and antagonistic interactions identified. In examining the mechanisms by which physical activity-based functional recovery after spinal cord injury is effected, endogenous neural stem cells, in our opinion, engender a potentially key role. Multipotent neural stem cells possess many faculties that abet recovery, including the ability to assess the local microenvironment and deliver biofactors that promote neuroplasticity and regeneration, as well as the potential to replenish damaged or eradicated cellular elements. Encouragingly, the functional recovery owing to physical activity-based therapies appears relatively robust, even when therapy is initiated in the chronic stage of spinal cord injury. In this article, we review experimental outcomes related to our hypothesis that endogenous neural stem cells mediate the functional recovery noted in spinal cord injury following physical activity-based treatments. Overall, the data advocates the incorporation of increased physical activity as a component of the multidimensional treatment of spinal cord injury and underscores the critical need to employ research-based mechanistic approaches for developing future advances in the rehabilitation of neurological injury and disorders."
Therapeutic Effect of Exosomes Derived From Stem Cells in Spinal Cord Injury: A Systematic Review Based on Animal Studies,"Zhang C, Deng R, Zhang G, He X, Chen H, Chen B, Wan L, Kang X.","AB  - Transplantation of bone marrow stem cells into spinal cord lesions enhances axonal regeneration and promotes functional recovery in animal studies. There are two types of adult bone marrow stem cell; hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The mechanisms by which HSCs and MSCs might promote spinal cord repair following transplantation have been extensively investigated. The objective of this review is to discuss these mechanisms; we briefly consider the controversial topic of HSC and MSC transdifferentiation into central nervous system cells but focus on the neurotrophic, tissue sparing, and reparative action of MSC grafts in the context of the spinal cord injury (SCI) milieu. We then discuss some of the specific issues related to the translation of HSC and MSC therapies for patients with SCI and present a comprehensive critique of the current bone marrow cell clinical trials for the treatment of SCI to date."
Stem cell-based therapy for systemic lupus erythematous,"Zare Moghaddam M, Mousavi MJ, Ghotloo S.","AB  - BACKGROUND: Orthobiologics have shown promise in repair, restoration and regeneration of damaged and degenerated spine, joint and musculoskeletal tissues. The role of MSCs is to reduce inflammation, gliosis, and oxidative stress, while encouraging angiogenesis, neuronal proliferation, cell survival, and differentiation. While autologous MSCs have homologous advantages, they present with challenges related to donor predisposition, harvesting skills, and processing times. In this regard, allogenic MSCs show promise, but face ethical challenges, contamination, and survival risks. Ongoing efforts to overcome challenges and enhance performance include bioprinting, tissue engineering, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, and microenvironmental alteration, among many others. Genetically programmed MSCs are being explored and tissue regeneration is now considered a real possibility. In this article, we discuss some of the leading-edge technologies in the process of being developed and perfected for widespread clinical application. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this narrative review is both to update on orthobiologics, especially MSCs and provide a vision for their future potential in interventional spine medicine. STUDY DESIGN: Narrative review. METHODS: The PubMed database of the National Institute of Medicine and Google Scholar were searched for keywords mesenchymal stem cell"
Role of IL-6 in spinal cord injury in a mouse model,"Nakamura M, Okada S, Toyama Y, Okano H.","AB  - In recent years, various studies have been conducted toward the goal of achieving regeneration of the central nervous system using neural stem cells. However, various complex factors are involved in the regulation of neural stem cell differentiation, and many unresolved questions remain. It has been reported that after spinal cord injury, the intrinsic neural stem cells do not differentiate into neurons but, rather, into astrocytes, resulting in the formation of glial scars. Based on reports that the expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and the IL-6 receptor (IL- 6R) is sharply increased in the acute stages after spinal cord injury and that IL-6 may serve as a factor strongly inducing the differentiation of neural stem cells into astrocytes, we examined the effects of an antibody to IL-6R in cases of spinal cord injury and found that the antibody suppressed secondary injury (caused by inflammatory reactions) and glial scar formation, facilitating functional recovery. This article presents the data from this investigation and discusses the relationship between IL-6 signals and spinal cord injury."
Does being female provide a neuroprotective advantage following spinal cord injury?,"Datto JP, Yang J, Dietrich WD, Pearse DD.","AB  - Cell transplantation therapies have become a major focus in pre-clinical research as a promising strategy for the treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI). In this article, we systematically review the available pre-clinical literature on the most commonly used cell types in order to assess the body of evidence that may support their translation to human SCI patients. These cell types include Schwann cells, olfactory ensheathing glial cells, embryonic and adult neural stem/progenitor cells, fate-restricted neural/glial precursor cells, and bone-marrow stromal cells. Studies were included for review only if they described the transplantation of the cell substrate into an in-vivo model of traumatic SCI, induced either bluntly or sharply. Using these inclusion criteria, 162 studies were identified and reviewed in detail, emphasizing their behavioral effects (although not limiting the scope of the discussion to behavioral effects alone). Significant differences between cells of the same type"" exist based on the species and age of donor"
Potential roles of the neural stem cell in the restoration of the injured spinal cord: review of the literature,"Kabatas S, Teng YD.","AB  - The fast pace of research in stem cell biology and regenerative medicine is feeding hopes of the scientific community and the public that a new revolution in treatments is upon us. There are increasing numbers of examples of stem cell therapies that are effective in treating animal injuries and diseases. There is an expectation that stem cell transplantation will soon be commonplace in the human clinic, especially with the beginnings of clinical trials of embryonic stem cell transplantation for bone repair, spinal cord injury, macular degeneration, Stargardt's disease, and Batten's disease. This may be an appropriate point at which to review our experiences in moving from the lab to the clinic to initiate a Phase I clinical trial of autologous olfactory ensheathing cells in spinal cord injured humans."
"Biologics in Interventional Spinal Procedure: The Past, the Present, and the Vision",Navani A.,"AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) often leads to persistent functional deficits due to the loss of neurons and glia and to limited axonal regeneration after such injury. Recently, three independent groups have reported marked recovery of hindlimb locomotor function after the transplantation of human adult dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) and stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHEDs) into rats or mice with acute, sub-acute or chronic SCI. This review summarizes the primary characteristics of human dental pulp stem cells and their therapeutic benefits for treating SCI. Experimental data from multiple preclinical studies suggest that pulp stem cells may promote functional recovery after SCI through multifaceted neuro-regenerative activities."
Cellular therapy for traumatic neurological injury,Cox CS Jr.,"AB  - The global incidence of spinal cord injury (SCI) is 15-40 cases per million people, with the socioeconomic and healthcare costs amounting to nearly $10 billion per annum in the USA alone. Despite substantial advances in medical care and surgical technology, many patients with SCI still experience significant long-term neurologic disability. Cellular transplantation offers a promising therapy to address the multifactorial nature of SCI in both the subacute and chronic phase of the injury to promote central nervous system repair and regeneration and to augment existing therapies. Adult-derived stem cells are the least ethically challenging stem cells but, until recently, a major hurdle has been inducing pluripotency to generate the required neural lineages. Improved generation and transfection techniques, combined with positive experimental outcomes in SCI models, suggest that adult-derived induced pluripotent stem cells could be a genuine alternative to embryonic stem cells for clinical treatments. For translation from bench to bedside, the efficacy of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem and progenitor cells in suitable SCI models needs to be validated further and backed up with rigorous early-stage clinical trials."
Stem cells and regenerative medicine for neural repair,Takahashi J.,"AB  - Neurological injury is the primary lethal mechanism of injury in children, and the primary etiology of long-term disability after trauma. Laboratories and clinical/translational teams have sought to develop stem/progenitor cell therapies to improve recovery in a clinical setting in which there is no significant reparative option. While none of these treatments are currently standard therapeutics, phase IIb clinical trials are underway in both adults and children in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and phase I/IIa trials in spinal cord injury. This review will characterize the cell therapy strategies: cell replacement and tissue integration vs. immunomodulation/enhanced endogenous tissue repair. TBI is somewhat different from other central nervous system injuries (spinal cord injury and stroke), in that TBI is a diffuse injury, whereas spinal cord injury and stroke are anatomically discrete. Importantly, this drives cell therapy approaches, as TBI is less apt to be treatable with a local cell replacement intervention. More localized injuries may be more amenable to local approaches and cell replacement to bridge focal gaps. This review focuses on a few reports in the field that highlight areas of progress, but is not intended to be a comprehensive survey of the state of regenerative medicine for neurological injuries."

Regarding future PSC-based clinical trials for other neurological diseases, these trials have been instrumental at recognizing first, the difference between research cell lines and clinical cell lines of a stem cell product, second, the selection of an appropriate animal model for pre-clinical study, third, criteria and the quality control of donor cells, and fourth, the mode of action of the grafts."
Multiple strategies enhance the efficacy of MSC-Exos transplantation for spinal cord injury,"Xu Y, Wang X, Zhou X, Zeng W, Yuan J, Ye J.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating disease that results in severe motor, sensory, and autonomic dysfunction, for which there are currently no available treatments. Subsequent to the primary mechanical damage, progressive secondary damage further exacerbates the functional deficit. Demyelination may play an important role in the pathogenesis of SCI. Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are considered a candidate cellular treatment approach for SCI attributable to their unique potential. Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of OPC transplantation in rat models with traumatic thoracic SCI, and 17 studies (20 experiments, 402 rats) were identified. The Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating score, latency and amplitude of motor evoked potential (MEP), percentage of myelinated axons, and cavity size were used as outcome measurements. The pooled results of the meta-analysis in different subgroups (based on cell dose or sex) both suggested that the BBB score of the OPC group was significantly improved compared to that of the control group 2, 4, and 8 weeks after transplantation. Whereas the amplitude of MEP was not significantly different, the latency of MEP was significantly shorter compared to that of the control group 4 weeks after transplantation. The percentage of myelinated axons increased significantly in the OPC group compared to that of the control group after OPC transplantation. Area measurements across groups revealed a significant reduction in cavity size in the OPC-treated groups compared to the control group. In conclusion, OPC transplantation provided considerable beneficial effects after traumatic SCI."
The global state of research in stem cells therapy for spinal cord injury (2003-2022): a visualized analysis,"Chen T, Zhu J, Wang G, Sun J, Ma X, Tian L, Zhang M, Wang F, Yu Z.","AB  - The use of stem cells in the treatment of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) in recent years has provided promising results. Different sources of cells for transplantation have been used, including neural progenitor cells (NPCs), neural stem cells (NSCs) or embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Experimental and clinical studies are currently underway to define the potentials of stem cells in the treatment of SCI. As implantation-based neural cellular restoratory therapy develops, SCI that has not been typically treated by surgical procedures, will be ultimately introduced within the realm of neurosurgery. It is thus imperative that neurosurgeons have an understanding of and in-depth training in research endeavors related to the field of stem cell biology. This paper aims to briefly review the current status and potential of using stem cells to repair experimental SCI."
Nontumor lesions of spinal cord and spine,Tatke M.,"AB  - It has been controversial whether gender has any effect on recovery following spinal cord injury (SCI). Past experimental and clinical research aimed at addressing this subject has led to constrasting findings on whether females hold any advantage in locomotor recovery. Additionally, for studies supporting the notion of a female gender related advantage, a definite cause has not been explained. In a recent study, using large sample sizes for comparative male and female spinal cord injury cohorts, we reported that a significant gender advantage favoring females existed in both tissue preservation and functional recovery after taking into consideration discrepancies in age and weight of the animals across sexes. Prior animal research frequently used sample sizes that were too small to determine significance with certainty and also did not account for two other factors that influence locomotor performance: age and weight. Our finding is important in light of controversy surrounding the effect of gender on outcome and the fact that SCI affects more than ten thousand new individuals annually, a population that is disproportionately male. By deepening our understanding of why a gender advantage exists, potential new therapeutics can be designed to improve recovery for the male population following the initial trauma or putatively augment the neuroprotective privilege in females for enhanced outcomes."
Efficacy of Oligodendrocyte Progenitor Cell Transplantation in Rat Models with Traumatic Thoracic Spinal Cord Injury: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Fu H, Hu D, Zhang L, Shen X, Tang P.","AB  - OBJECTIVE: A systematic review of the role of stem cell-derived exosomes in repairing spinal cord injury (SCI) and the existing problems in animal experiments to provide a reference for better animal experiments and clinical studies in the future. METHOD: Three electronic databases, namely PubMed, Web of Science, and Ovid-Embase were searched. The studies were retrieved from inception to October 2021. Two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted data, and evaluated the methodological quality based on the inclusion criteria. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Thirty-two studies were incorporated into the final analyses. Exosomes derived from stem cells could not only significantly improve the motor function of animals with SCI, but also significantly increase the expression of anti-inflammatory factors IL-4 and IL-10 and anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, while significantly lowering the pro-inflammatory factor IL-1β and TNF-α and the expression of the apoptotic protein BAX. However, the mechanism of exosome-mediated SCI repair, as well as the best source and dosage remain unknown. In addition, there are still some issues with the design, implementation, and reporting of animal experiments in the included studies. Therefore, future research should further standardize the implementation and reporting of animal studies and fully explore the best strategies for exosomes to repair SCI so as to promote the translation of preclinical research results to clinical research better and faster."
[Current situation and progression of induced pluripotent stem cells in treating spinal cord injury],"Liu W, Zhang SK, Yan M, Liu LD.","AB  - INTRODUCTION: In spite of extensive research, the progress toward a cure in spinal cord injury (SCI) is still elusive, which holds good for the cell- and stem cell-based therapies. We have critically analyzed seven known gray areas in SCI, indicating the specific arenas for research to improvise the outcome of cell-based therapies in SCI. AREAS COVERED: The seven, specific known gray areas in SCI analyzed are: i) the gap between animal models and human victims; ii) uncertainty about the time, route and dosage of cells applied; iii) source of the most efficacious cells for therapy; iv) inability to address the vascular compromise during SCI; v) lack of non-invasive methodologies to track the transplanted cells; vi) need for scaffolds to retain the cells at the site of injury; and vii) physical and chemical stimuli that might be required for synapses formation yielding functional neurons. EXPERT OPINION: Further research on scaffolds for retaining the transplanted cells at the lesion, chemical and physical stimuli that may help neurons become functional, a meta-analysis of timing of the cell therapy, mode of application and larger clinical studies are essential to improve the outcome."
[Novel aspects of diagnostics and therapy of spinal cord diseases],"Rupp R, Blesch A, Schad L, Draganski B, Weidner N.","AB  - Nontumor lesions of the spinal cord and spine include developmental disorders, cystic tumor-like lesions, vascular disorders, infective diseases, demyelinating diseases, degenerative diseases, metabolic and toxic disorders, and spinal cord injury. In addition, diseases of the spine and extradural spaces secondarily cause spinal cord injury. Aside from tumors, these include developmental abnormalities, inflammatory diseases, nontumor space-occupying lesions, and tumor-like lesions such as lipomas, vascular malformations, and cysts. Awareness is required of hemostatic agents used during surgery and subsequently presenting as space-occupying lesions, which have to be differentiated from recurrent lesions. On the therapeutic front, stem cell transplantation into spinal cord for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, spinal cord injury, and multiple sclerosis is a challenging prospect."
Concise review: Spinal cord injuries: how could adult mesenchymal and neural crest stem cells take up the challenge?,"Neirinckx V, Cantinieaux D, Coste C, Rogister B, Franzen R, Wislet-Gendebien S.","AB  - Spinal cord injury is a difficult medical problem and current therapeutic methods could not obtain satisfactory results. Recent 20 years, stem cell technology developed rapidly, embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells were used for treating neurological disease and nerve injury of animal models and the clinical results were confirmed. It provided a new prospect for the treatment of nerve injury at the cellular level. However,due to technical and ethical problems, it is difficult to obtain the appropriate cells that can be applied to the human being. Recently, induced pluripotent stem cells were developed as a new method for the treatment of spinal cord injuries by the autologous transplantation. Starting from this work, the purpose of this review is to assess the differentiate ability of induced pluripotent stem cells into neurocyte and review the latest developments in this area."
Mesenchymal cells in the treatment of spinal cord injury: current & future perspectives,"Vawda R, Fehlings MG.","AB  - BACKGROUND AIMS: Several studies have reported that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) may improve neurological functions in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). In this study, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the effects of MSC treatment on different degrees of severity of SCI. METHODS: Systematic searching of studies reporting outcomes of MSCs on specific injury severities of patients with SCI was performed in The National Library of Medicine (MEDLINE), Embase and Cochrane for published articles up to the 6 July 2022. Two investigators independently reviewed the included studies and extracted the relevant data. The standardized mean differences of American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor score, ASIA light touch scores, ASIA pinprick scores and the Barthel index between baseline and follow-ups were pooled. RESULTS: A total of eight studies were included. A large majority focused on patients with ASIA grade A classification. The pooled mean differences of ASIA motor scores, ASIA light touch scores, ASIA pinprick scores and the Barthel index were -2.78 (95% confidence interval [CI] -5.12 to -0.43, P = 0.02), -18.26 (95% CI -26.09 to -10.43, P < 0.01), -17.08 (95% CI -24.10 to -10.07, P < 0.01) and -4.37 (95% CI -10.96 to 2.22, P = 0.19), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: MSC transplantation was a significantly effective therapy for patients with SCI with ASIA grade A. In the future, further studies are warranted to confirm the potential beneficial effects of MSC therapy."
Progress and prospects in neurorehabilitation: clinical applications of stem cells and brain-computer interface for spinal cord lesions,"Gongora M, Peressutti C, Machado S, Teixeira S, Velasques B, Ribeiro P.","AB  - Acute inflammatory diseases such as acute colitis, kidney injury, liver failure, lung injury, myocardial infarction, pancreatitis, septic shock, and spinal cord injury are significant causes of death worldwide. Despite advances in the understanding of its pathophysiology, there are many restrictions in the treatment of these diseases, and new therapeutic approaches are required. Mesenchymal stem cell-based therapy due to immunomodulatory and regenerative properties is a promising candidate for acute inflammatory disease management. Based on preclinical results, mesenchymal stem cells and their-derived secretome improved immunological and clinical parameters. Furthermore, many clinical trials of acute kidney, liver, lung, myocardial, and spinal cord injury have yielded promising results. In this review, we try to provide a comprehensive view of mesenchymal stem cell-based therapy in acute inflammatory diseases as a new treatment approach."
Experimental treatments to attenuate blood spinal cord barrier rupture in rats with traumatic spinal cord injury: A meta-analysis and systematic review,"Deng L, Lv JQ, Sun L.","AB  - Stem cells play important role in the development and in the maintenance of specific tissues.

Endogenous neural progenitor cells as therapeutic target after spinal cord injury,"Obermair FJ, Schröter A, Thallmair M.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a disease that affects millions of people worldwide, causing a temporary or permanent impairment of neuromotor functions. Mostly associated to traumatic lesions, but also to other forms of disease, the appropriate treatment is still unsure. In this review, several ongoing studies are presented that aim to provide methods of prevention that ensure quality of life, and rehabilitation trends to patients who suffer from this injury. Stem cell research, highlighted in this review, seeks to reduce damage caused to the tissue, as also provide spinal cord regeneration through the application of several types of stem cells. On the other hand, research using brain-computer interface (BCI) technology proposes the development of interfaces based on the interaction of neural networks with artificial tools to restore motor control and full mobility of the injured area.

Cellular and paracellular transplants for spinal cord injury: a review of the literature,"Mortazavi MM, Verma K, Tubbs RS, Theodore N.","AB  - BACKGROUND: While there is no certain treatment for spinal cord injury (SCI), stem cellbased therapy may be an attractive alternative, but the survival and differentiation of cells in the host tissue are poor. Conditioned medium (CM) has several beneficial effects on cells. OBJECTIVE: In this meta-analysis study, we examined the effect of CM on SCI treatment. METHODS: After searching on MEDLINE, SCOPUS, EMBASE, and Web of Science, first and secondary screening were performed based on title, abstract, and full text. The data were extracted from the included studies, and meta-analysis was performed using STATA.14 software. A standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval was used to report findings. Quality control and subgroup analysis were also performed. RESULTS: The results from 52 articles and 61 separate experiments showed that CM had a significantly strong effect on improving motor function after SCI (SMD = 2.58; 95% CI: 2.17 to 2.98; p < 0.001) and also analysis of data from 12 articles demonstrated that CM reduced the expression of GFAP marker (SMD = -4.16; p < 0.0001) compared to SCI group without any treatment. Subgroup analysis showed that treatment with CM of neural stem cells was better than CM of mesenchymal stem cells. It was more effective after a mild lesion than a moderate or severe one. The improvement was more pronounced with <4 weeks than >4 weeks follow-up. CONCLUSION: CM had a significant effect in improving motor function after SCI, especially in cases of mild lesions. It has been observed that if CM originates from the neural stem cells, it has a more significant effect than mesenchymal cells."
"Current Advances in Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapies Applied to Wounds and Skin, Eye, and Neuromuscular Diseases in Companion Animals","Picazo RA, Rojo C, Rodriguez-Quiros J, González-Gil A.","AB  - BACKGROUND: Stem cell therapy provides great promising therapeutic benefits for various neurological disorders. Cell transplantation has emerged as cell replacement application for nerve damage. Recently, nanomaterials obtain wide development in various industrial and medical fields, and nanoparticles have been applied in the neurological field for tracking and treating nervous system diseases. Combining stem cells with nanotechnology has raised more and more attentions; and it has demonstrated that the combination has huge effects on clinical diagnosis and therapeutics in multiple central nervous system diseases, meanwhile, improves prognosis. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to give a brief overview of the application of nanomaterials in stem cell therapy for neurological diseases. RESULTS: Nanoparticles not only promote stem cell proliferation and differentiation in vitro or in vivo, but also play dominant roles on stem cell imaging and tracking. Furthermore, via delivering genes or drugs, nanoparticles can participate in stem cell therapeutic applications for various neurological diseases, such as ischemic stroke, spinal cord injury (SCI), multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and gliomas. However, nanoparticles have potential cytotoxic effects on nerve cells, which are related to their physicochemical properties.

Regenerative cellular therapies for neurologic diseases,"Levy M, Boulis N, Rao M, Svendsen CN.","AB  - Since several years, adult/perinatal mesenchymal and neural crest stem cells have been widely used to help experimental animal to recover from spinal cord injury. More interestingly, recent clinical trials confirmed the beneficial effect of those stem cells, which improve functional score of patients suffering from such lesions. However, a complete understanding of the mechanisms of stem cell-induced recovery is seriously lacking. Indeed, spinal cord injuries gathered a wide range of biochemical and physiopathological events (such as inflammation, oxidative stress, axonal damage, demyelination, etc.) and the genuine healing process after cell transplantation is not sufficiently defined. This review aims to sum up recent data about cell therapy in spinal cord lesions using mesenchymal or recently identified neural crest stem cells, by describing precisely which physiopathological parameter is affected and the exact processes underlying the observed changes. Overall, although significant advances are acknowledged, it seems that further deep mechanistic investigation is needed for the development of optimized and efficient cell-based therapy protocols."
Efficacy of mesenchymal stromal cells intraspinal transplantation for patients with different degrees of spinal cord injury: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Mou C, Wang X, Li W, Li Z, Liu N, Xu Y.",AB  - Growing knowledge about the role of neural progenitor cells supports the hope that stem cell-based therapeutic approaches aimed at restoring function in the lesioned central nervous system can be established. Possible therapies for promoting recovery after spinal cord injury include stimulating the formation of neurons and glial cells by endogenous progenitor cells. This article reviews the current knowledge about the nature of adult progenitor cells in the intact and injured spinal cord and summarizes possibilities and limitations of cellular replacement strategies based on manipulations of endogenous spinal cord progenitor cells and their environment.
Neural stem cells & supporting cells--the new therapeutic tools for the treatment of spinal cord injury,"Paspala SA, Balaji AB, Nyamath P, Ahmed KS, Khan AA, Khaja MN, Narsu ML, Devi YP, Murthy TV, Habibullah CM.","AB  - Nearly 1.5 million people in the US live with a spinal cord injury (SCI). The cost to the healthcare system is estimated at over $10 billion annually likely because over 65% of SCIs occur at the cervical level. Despite medical advances, many SCI patients still experience substantial neurological disability and high dependency with severe loss of motor, sensory and autonomic function. The consensus from a combination of in vivo studies and in vivo models is that mesenchymal or stromal cells, and possibly even neural progenitors, regardless of derivation act through the provision of trophic support and inflammatory modulation. Indeed, they have been found to secrete a wide spectrum of diffusible factors with known roles in both. As such, mesenchymal cells, obtainable from multiple tissues, are ideally suited to addressing many pathophysiological consequences of SCI. Advances in understanding the latter, structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging, image-guided microneurosurgical techniques and transplantable cell biology have enabled the clinical use of cell-based therapies. Of the twenty most recent cell therapy clinical trials for SCI, seven involve adult bone marrow mesenchymal cells and six others umbilical cord cells. This reflects the growing recognition of the clinical potential of perinatal cells. However, a limited understanding of how best to exploit the capabilities of these cells impedes a full-scale clinical deployment. This mini-review focuses on recent developments that are likely to facilitate the targeted application of these cells to treat specific secondary pathophysiological processes."

The Spinal Ependymal Layer in Health and Disease,Moore SA.,"AB  - In the past few years, stem cells have become the focus of research by regenerative medicine professionals and tissue engineers. Embryonic stem cells, although capable of differentiating into cell lineages of all three germ layers, are limited in their utilization due to ethical issues. In contrast, the autologous harvest and subsequent transplantation of adult stem cells from bone marrow, adipose tissue or blood have been experimentally utilized in the treatment of a wide variety of diseases ranging from myocardial infarction to Alzheimer's disease. The physiologic consequences of stem cell transplantation and its impact on functional recovery have been studied in countless animal models and select clinical trials. Unfortunately, the bench to bedside translation of this research has been slow. Nonetheless, stem cell therapy has received the attention of spinal surgeons due to its potential benefits in the treatment of neural damage, muscle trauma, disk degeneration and its potential contribution to bone fusion."
Mesenchymal stem cell-based therapy as a new therapeutic approach for acute inflammation,"Abdolmohammadi K, Mahmoudi T, Alimohammadi M, Tahmasebi S, Zavvar M, Hashemi SM.","AB  - Background: Traumatic spinal cord injury (t-SCI) is a severe injury that has a devastating impact on neurological function. Blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB) destruction following SCI aggravates the primary injury, resulting in a secondary injury. A series of experimental treatments have been proven to alleviate BSCB destruction after t-SCI. Methods: From a screen of 1,189 papers, which were retrieved from Pubmed, Embase, and Web of science, we identified 28 papers which adhered to strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Evans blue (EB) leakage on the first day post-SCI was selected as the primary result. Secondary outcomes included the expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins and adhesion junction (AJ) proteins in protein immunoblotting. In addition, we measured functional recovery using the Basso, Beattie, Besnahan (BBB) score and we analyzed the relevant mechanisms to explore the similarities between different studies. Result: The forest plot of Evans blue leakage (EB leakage) reduction rate: the pooled effect size of the 28 studies was 0.54, 95% CI: 0.47-0.61, p < 0.01. This indicates that measures to mitigate BSCB damage significantly improved in reducing overall EB leakage. In addition TJ proteins (Occludin, Claudin-5, and ZO-1), AJ proteins (P120 and β-catenin) were significantly upregulated after treatment in all publications. Moreover, BBB scores were significantly improved. Comprehensive studies have shown that in t-SCI, inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is the most commonly used mechanism to mitigate BSCB damage, followed by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the Akt pathway. In addition, we found that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (BMSC-Exos), which inhibit the TIMP2/MMP signaling pathway, may be the most effective way to alleviate BSCB injury. Conclusion: This study systematically analyzes the experimental treatments and their mechanisms for reducing BSCB injury in the early stage of t-SCI. BMSC-Exos, which inhibit MMP expression, are currently the most effective therapeutic modality for alleviating BSCB damage. In addition, the regulation of MMPs in particular as well as the Akt pathway and the ER stress pathway play important roles in alleviating BSCB injury.

This review summarizes the current state of regenerative stem cell transplantation divided into seven conditions for which trials are currently active: demyelinating diseases/spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, macular degeneration and peripheral nerve diseases. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled SI: PSC and the brain."
Clinical outcome of autologous mononuclear cells transplantation for spinal cord injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Aghayan HR, Arjmand B, Yaghoubi M, Moradi-Lakeh M, Kashani H, Shokraneh F.","AB  - BACKGROUND: Both non-traumatic and traumatic spinal cord injuries have in common that a relatively minor structural lesion can cause profound sensorimotor and autonomous dysfunction. Besides treating the cause of the spinal cord injury the main goal is to restore lost function as far as possible. AIM: This article provides an overview of current innovative diagnostic (imaging) and therapeutic approaches (neurorehabilitation and neuroregeneration) aiming for recovery of function after non-traumatic and traumatic spinal cord injuries. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An analysis of the current scientific literature regarding imaging, rehabilitation and rehabilitation strategies in spinal cord disease was carried out. RESULTS: Novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based techniques (e.g. diffusion-weighted MRI and functional MRI) allow visualization of structural reorganization and specific neural activity in the spinal cord. Robotics-driven rehabilitative measures provide training of sensorimotor function in a targeted fashion, which can even be continued in the homecare setting. From a preclinical point of view, defined stem cell transplantation approaches allow for the first time robust structural repair of the injured spinal cord. CONCLUSION: Besides well-established neurological and functional scores, MRI techniques offer the unique opportunity to provide robust and reliable biomarkers"" for restorative therapeutic interventions. Function-oriented robotics-based rehabilitative interventions alone or in combination with stem cell based therapies represent promising approaches to achieve substantial functional recovery"
Research progress of exosomes in orthopedics,"Zhang L, Lin Y, Zhang X, Shan C.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a complex pathological process. Based on the encouraging results of preclinical experiments, some stem cell therapies have been translated into clinical practice. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have become one of the most important seed cells in the treatment of SCI due to their abundant sources, strong proliferation ability and low immunogenicity. However, the survival rate of MSCs transplanted to spinal cord injury is rather low, which hinders its further clinical application. In recent years, hydrogel materials have been widely used in tissue engineering because of their good biocompatibility and biodegradability. The treatment strategy of hydrogel combined with MSCs has made some progress in SCI repair. This review discusses the significance and the existing problems of MSCs in the repair of SCI. It also describes the research progress of hydrogel combined with MSCs in repairing SCI, and prospects its application in clinical research, aiming at providing reference and new ideas for future SCI treatment."
[Research progress of hydrogel combined with mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of spinal cord injury],"Yuan X, Ding L, Deng DYB.","AB  - BACKGROUND: Cell-based therapies can be used to treat neurological diseases and spinal cord injuries. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical outcome of bone marrow derived mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) transplantation in patients with spinal cord injuries. METHODS: Following a systematic review to detect clinical intervention studies, a meta-analysis was done for pooling data to estimate the outcome of BM-MNCs transplantation. The percentage of the patients with improved ASIA scale from one grade to a higher grade was defined as the main outcome. By considering the study design and outcome measurement, two reviewers independently extracted the data. RESULTS: Eight relevant primary studies were found; seven qualified studies, with a combined total of 328 patients were assessed by meta-analysis, including 314 ASIA-A, 13 ASIA-B, 94 cervical, 227 thoracic and 60 acute injuries. The percentage of the patients' improvement was tested by meta-analysis through random and fixed models. The overall percentage of all patients' improved ASIA scale after a one- year follow-up (95% CIs) was 43 (0.27-0.59). CONCLUSION: Data from published trials revealed that encouraging results were achieved by autologous BMMNCs for the treatment of spinal cord injury. However, the number of clinical trials included in the systematic review was too limited to reach a definite conclusion. More qualified clinical trials with standardized methods are needed to truly justify the outcome of this therapeutic modality in SCI patients."
Cell and biomolecule delivery for tissue repair and regeneration in the central nervous system,"Elliott Donaghue I, Tam R, Sefton MV, Shoichet MS.","AB  - Ependymal cells are epithelial support cells that line the central canal and ventricular cavities of the central nervous system, providing the interface between the cerebrospinal fluid and the parenchyma of the brain and spinal cord. The spinal ependymal layer (SEL) is composed of 3 main cell types: tanycytes, ependymocytes, and cerebrospinal fluid-contacting neurons. A fourth cell type, termed the supraependymal cell, is also occasionally described. Cells of the SEL show restricted proliferative capacity in health but display neural stem cell properties both in vitro and in vivo in various disease states. A growing body of literature is devoted to the regenerative roles of the SEL, particularly in the context of spinal cord injury, where mechanical damage to the spinal cord leads to a significant increase in SEL proliferation. SEL-derived cell progeny migrate to sites of injury within the injured spinal cord parenchyma and contribute primarily to glial scar formation. In additional to their role as endogenous neural stem cells, cells of the SEL may be an important source of cytokines and other cell signaling molecules, such as tumor necrosis factor, heat shock proteins, and various growth factors. The SEL has become of recent interest to neuroscience researchers because of its potential to participate in and respond to diseases affecting the spinal cord (eg, traumatic spinal cord injury) and neurodegenerative disease. The intimate association of the SEL with the cerebrospinal fluid makes intrathecal therapies a viable option, and recent studies highlight the potential promise of treatments that augment SEL responses to disease."
Stem Cells in Functional Bladder Engineering,"Smolar J, Salemi S, Horst M, Sulser T, Eberli D.","AB  - Tissue engineering frequently involves cells and scaffolds to replace damaged or diseased tissue. It originated, in part, as a means of effecting the delivery of biomolecules such as insulin or neurotrophic factors, given that cells are constitutive producers of such therapeutic agents. Thus cell delivery is intrinsic to tissue engineering. Controlled release of biomolecules is also an important tool for enabling cell delivery since the biomolecules can enable cell engraftment, modulate inflammatory response or otherwise benefit the behavior of the delivered cells. We describe advances in cell and biomolecule delivery for tissue regeneration, with emphasis on the central nervous system (CNS). In the first section, the focus is on encapsulated cell therapy. In the second section, the focus is on biomolecule delivery in polymeric nano/microspheres and hydrogels for the nerve regeneration and endogenous cell stimulation. In the third section, the focus is on combination strategies of neural stem/progenitor cell or mesenchymal stem cell and biomolecule delivery for tissue regeneration and repair. In each section, the challenges and potential solutions associated with delivery to the CNS are highlighted."
Adult spinal cord ependymal layer: a promising pool of quiescent stem cells to treat spinal cord injury,"Panayiotou E, Malas S.","AB  - Exosomes are nano-extracellular vesicles secreted by a variety of cells. They are composed of a double-layer membrane that can transport a variety of proteins, coding and non-coding genes, and bioactive substances. Exosomes participate in information transmission between cells and regulate processes such as cell proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and phenotypic transformation. They have broad prospects in the occurrence, development, and treatment of many diseases including orthopedics. Exosomes derived from different types of bone cells such as mesenchymal stem cells, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and their precursors are recognized to play pivotal roles in bone remodeling processes including osteogenesis, osteoclastogenesis, and angiogenesis. This articlesummarizes the characteristics of exosomes and their research progress in bone remodeling, bone tumors, vascular skeletal muscle injury, spinal cord injury, degenerative disc diseases, cartilage degeneration, osteoarthritis, necrosis of the femoral head, and osteoporosis."
Stem cell therapy for treatment of epilepsy,"Goodarzi P, Aghayan HR, Soleimani M, Norouzi-Javidan A, Mohamadi-Jahani F, Jahangiri S, Emami-Razavi SH, Larijani B, Arjmand B.","AB  - Conditions impairing bladder function in children and adults, such as myelomeningocele, posterior urethral valves, bladder exstrophy or spinal cord injury, often need urinary diversion or augmentation cystoplasty as when untreated they may cause severe bladder dysfunction and kidney failure. Currently, the gold standard therapy of end-stage bladder disease refractory to conservative management is enterocystoplasty, a surgical enlargement of the bladder with intestinal tissue. Despite providing functional improvement, enterocystoplasty is associated with significant long-term complications, such as recurrent urinary tract infections, metabolic abnormalities, stone formation, and malignancies. Therefore, there is a strong clinical need for alternative therapies for these reconstructive procedures, of which stem cell-based tissue engineering (TE) is considered to be the most promising future strategy. This review is focused on the recent progress in bladder stem cell research and therapy and the challenges that remain for the development of a functional bladder wall."
Progress and prospects: stem cells and neurological diseases,"Gögel S, Gubernator M, Minger SL.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a major health burden and currently there is no effective medical intervention. Research performed over the last decade revealed that cells surrounding the central canal of the adult spinal cord and forming the ependymal layer acquire stem cell properties either in vitro or in response to injury. Following SCI activated ependymal cells generate progeny cells which migrate to the injury site but fail to produce the appropriate type of cells in sufficient number to limit the damage, rendering this physiological response mainly ineffective. Research is now focusing on the manipulation of ependymal cells to produce cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage which are primarily lost in such a situation leading to secondary neuronal degeneration. Thus, there is a need for a more focused approach to understand the molecular properties of adult ependymal cells in greater detail and develop effective strategies for guiding their response during SCI."
Concise Review: Stem Cell Trials Using Companion Animal Disease Models,"Hoffman AM, Dow SW.","AB  - Vimentin is a major type III intermediate filament protein that plays important roles in several basic cellular functions including cell migration, proliferation, and division. Although vimentin is a cytoplasmic protein, it also exists in the extracellular matrix and at the cell surface. Previous studies have shown that vimentin may exert multiple physiological effects in different nervous system injuries and diseases. For example, the studies of vimentin in spinal cord injury and stroke mainly focus on the formation of reactive astrocytes. Reduced glial scar, increased axonal regeneration, and improved motor function have been noted after spinal cord injury in vimentin and glial fibrillary acidic protein knockout (GFAP(-/-)VIM(-/-)) mice. However, attenuated glial scar formation in post-stroke in GFAP(-/-) VIM(-/-) mice resulted in abnormal neuronal network restoration and worse neurological recovery. These opposite results have been attributed to the multiple roles of glial scar in different temporal and spatial conditions. In addition, extracellular vimentin may be a neurotrophic factor that promotes axonal extension by interaction with the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor. In the pathogenesis of bacterial meningitis, cell surface vimentin is a meningitis facilitator, acting as a receptor of multiple pathogenic bacteria, including E. coli K1, Listeria monocytogenes, and group B streptococcus. Compared with wild type mice, VIM(-/-) mice are less susceptible to bacterial infection and exhibit a reduced inflammatory response, suggesting that vimentin is necessary to induce the pathogenesis of meningitis. Recently published literature showed that vimentin serves as a double-edged sword in the nervous system, regulating axonal regrowth, myelination, apoptosis, and neuroinflammation. This review aims to provide an overview of vimentin in spinal cord injury, stroke, bacterial meningitis, gliomas, and peripheral nerve injury and to discuss the potential therapeutic methods involving vimentin manipulation in improving axonal regeneration, alleviating infection, inhibiting brain tumor progression, and enhancing nerve myelination."
Evaluation of stem-cell therapies in companion animal disease models: a concise review (2015-2023),"Williams ZJ, Pezzanite LM, Chow L, Rockow M, Dow SW.","AB  - A major consequence of traumatic brain and spinal cord injury is the loss of the myelin sheath, a cholesterol-rich layer of insulation that wraps around axons of the nervous system. In the central nervous system (CNS), myelin is produced and maintained by oligodendrocytes. Damage to the CNS may result in oligodendrocyte cell death and subsequent loss of myelin, which can have serious consequences for functional recovery. Demyelination impairs neuronal function by decelerating signal transmission along the axon and has been implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases. After a traumatic injury, mechanisms of endogenous remyelination in the CNS are limited and often fail, for reasons that remain poorly understood. One area of research focuses on enhancing this endogenous response. Existing techniques include the use of small molecules, RNA interference (RNAi), and monoclonal antibodies that target specific signaling components of myelination for recovery. Cell-based replacement strategies geared towards replenishing oligodendrocytes and their progenitors have been utilized by several groups in the last decade as well. In this review article, we discuss the effects of traumatic injury on oligodendrocytes in the CNS, the lack of endogenous remyelination, translational studies in rodent models promoting remyelination, and finally human clinical studies on remyelination in the CNS after injury."
Human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells in clinical trials,"Ilic D, Devito L, Miere C, Codognotto S.","AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have provided a promising tool for cell therapy. Umbilical cord (UC) is one of the best sources of MSCs since its collection is noninvasive, and effortless, and the cells from this source are more capable and prolific. It has been proven that the differentiation, migration and protective properties of UC-MSCs are superior compared with other kinds of stem cells. Moreover, incurable neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and Huntington, encourage scientists to apply UC-MSCs transplantation in order to find a definite treatment. This review will focus on the preclinical and clinical use of mesenchymal stem cells derived from human umbilical cord in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders."
Strategies for Oligodendrocyte and Myelin Repair in Traumatic CNS Injury,"Huntemer-Silveira A, Patil N, Brickner MA, Parr AM.","AB  - Spinal cord injuries are damages that result in complete or partial loss of sensation and/or mobility and affect the life qualities of many patients. Their pathophysiology includes primary and secondary processes, which are related with the activation of astrocytes and microgliacytes and the degeneration of oligodendrocytes. Although transplantation of embryonic stem cells or neural progenitor cells is an attractive strategy for repair of the injured central nervous system (CNS), transplantation of these cells alone for acute spinal cord injuries has not resulted in robust axon regeneration beyond the injury sites. This may be due to the progenitor cells differentiating to the cell types that support axon growth poorly and/or their inability to modify the inhibitory environment of adult CNS after injury. Recent studies indicate that transplantation of glial progenitor cells has exhibited beneficial effects on the recovery and promising future for the therapy strategy of spinal cord injury. In this review, we summarized the data from recent literature regarding glial implications in transplantation therapy of spinal cord injury."
Approaches for neural tissue regeneration,"Binan L, Ajji A, De Crescenzo G, Jolicoeur M.","AB  - The central nervous system has limited capacity of regenerating lost tissue in slowly progressive, degenerative neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease or Huntington's disease (HD), or in acute injuries resulting in rapid cell loss for example, in cerebrovascular damage (for example, stroke) or spinal cord injury. Although the adult brain contains small numbers of stem cells in restricted areas, they do not contribute significantly to functional recovery. Transplantation of stem cells or stem cell-derived progenitors has long been seen as a therapeutic solution to repair the damaged brain. With the advent of the induced pluripotent stem cells technique a new and potentially better source for transplantable cells may be available in future. This review aims to highlight current strategies to replace lost cellular populations in neurodegenerative diseases with the focus on HD and PD and traumatic brain injuries such as stroke, discussing many of the technical and biological issues associated with central nervous system cell transplantation."
Small molecules in stem cell research,"Schmöle AC, Hübner R, Beller M, Rolfs A, Frech MJ.","AB  - This classic discusses the original 1991 publication 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs)' by Dr. Caplan on the emergence of a new therapeutic technology of self-cell repair using MSCs. After the original classic publication, a large number of methods to regenerate injured tissue have been reported. Currently, MSCs are used clinically to repair articular cartilage defects, liver cirrhosis, cerebral infarction, spinal cord injury, graft-versus-host disease and others. As a result, MSCs are considered one of the most important cell sources for regenerative medicine. An MSC has been demonstrated to be a multipotent stem cell in cell culture and was thought to contribute to the regeneration of injured tissue at transplant sites, but recently, the concept of MSCs has changed such that they are now referred to as medicinal signaling cells"
Umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells in neurodegenerative disorders: from literature to clinical practice,"Reyhani S, Abbaspanah B, Mousavi SH.","AB  - BACKGROUND: Human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells (hESC and hiPSC) have tremendous potential for clinical implementation. In spite of all hurdles and controversy, clinical trials in treatment of spinal cord injury, macular degeneration of retina, type 1 diabetes and heart failure are already ongoing. SOURCES OF DATA: ClinicalTrials.gov database, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, PubMed and press releases and websites of companies and institutions working on hESC- and iPSC-based cellular therapy. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: The initial results from multiple clinical trials demonstrate that hESC-based therapies are safe and promising. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Are iPSC cells safe in the clinical application? Is there a room for both hESC and iPSC in the future clinical applications? GROWING POINTS: Increasing number of new clinical trials. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: Development of hESC- and/or iPSC-based cellular therapy for other diseases."
Central nervous system regeneration--where are we?,Williams A.,"AB  - Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) represents the initial tumor suppressor gene identified to possess phosphatase activity, governing various cellular processes including cell cycle regulation, migration, metabolic pathways, autophagy, oxidative stress response, and cellular senescence. Current evidence suggests that PTEN is critical for stem cell maintenance, self-renewal, migration, lineage commitment, and differentiation. Based on the latest available evidence, we provide a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms by which PTEN regulates activities of different stem cell populations and influences neurological disorders, encompassing autism, stroke, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This review aims to elucidate the therapeutic impacts and mechanisms of PTEN in relation to neurogenesis or the stem cell niche across a range of neurological disorders, offering a foundation for innovative therapeutic approaches aimed at tissue repair and regeneration in neurological disorders. This review unravels novel therapeutic strategies for tissue restoration and regeneration in neurological disorders based on the regulatory mechanisms of PTEN on neurogenesis and the stem cell niche."
Glial implications in transplantation therapy of spinal cord injury,"Chen SW, Xie YF.","AB  - Studies to evaluate the therapeutic potential of stem cells in humans would benefit from more realistic animal models. In veterinary medicine, companion animals naturally develop many diseases that resemble human conditions, therefore, representing a novel source of preclinical models. To understand how companion animal disease models are being studied for this purpose, we reviewed the literature between 2008 and 2015 for reports on stem cell therapies in dogs and cats, excluding laboratory animals, induced disease models, cancer, and case reports. Disease models included osteoarthritis, intervertebral disc degeneration, dilated cardiomyopathy, inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's fistulas, meningoencephalomyelitis (multiple sclerosis-like), keratoconjunctivitis sicca (Sjogren's syndrome-like), atopic dermatitis, and chronic (end-stage) kidney disease. Stem cells evaluated in these studies included mesenchymal stem-stromal cells (MSC, 17/19 trials), olfactory ensheathing cells (OEC, 1 trial), or neural lineage cells derived from bone marrow MSC (1 trial), and 16/19 studies were performed in dogs. The MSC studies (13/17) used adipose tissue-derived MSC from either allogeneic (8/13) or autologous (5/13) sources. The majority of studies were open label, uncontrolled studies. Endpoints and protocols were feasible, and the stem cell therapies were reportedly safe and elicited beneficial patient responses in all but two of the trials. In conclusion, companion animals with naturally occurring diseases analogous to human conditions can be recruited into clinical trials and provide realistic insight into feasibility, safety, and biologic activity of novel stem cell therapies. However, improvements in the rigor of manufacturing, study design, and regulatory compliance will be needed to better utilize these models. Stem Cells 2016;34:1709-1729."
Vimentin as a potential target for diverse nervous system diseases,"Chen KZ, Liu SX, Li YW, He T, Zhao J, Wang T, Qiu XX, Wu HF.","AB  - Central neurotrauma, such as spinal cord injury or traumatic brain injury, can damage critical axonal pathways and neurons and lead to partial to complete loss of neural function that is difficult to address in the mature central nervous system. Improvement and innovation in the development, manufacture, and delivery of stem-cell based therapies, as well as the continued exploration of newer forms of stem cells, have allowed the professional and public spheres to resolve technical and ethical questions that previously hindered stem cell research for central nervous system injury. Recent in vitro and in vivo models have demonstrated the potential that reprogrammed autologous stem cells, in particular, have to restore functionality and induce regeneration-while potentially mitigating technical issues of immunogenicity, rejection, and ethical issues of embryonic derivation. These newer stem-cell based approaches are not, however, without concerns and problems of safety, efficacy, use and distribution. This review is an assessment of the current state of the science, the potential solutions that have been and are currently being explored, and the problems and questions that arise from what appears to be a promising way forward (i.e., autologous stem cell-based therapies)-for the purpose of advancing the research for much-needed therapeutic interventions for central neurotrauma."
Applications of the Keap1-Nrf2 system for gene and cell therapy,"Kanninen KM, Pomeshchik Y, Leinonen H, Malm T, Koistinaho J, Levonen AL.","AB  - Nerve injuries can be life-long debilitating traumas that severely impact patients' quality of life. While many acellular neural scaffolds have been developed to aid the process of nerve regeneration, complete functional recovery is still very difficult to achieve, especially for long-gap peripheral nerve injury and most cases of spinal cord injury. Cell-based therapies have shown many promising results for improving nerve regeneration. With recent advances in neural tissue engineering, the integration of biomaterial scaffolds and cell transplantation are emerging as a more promising approach to enhance nerve regeneration. This review provides an overview of important considerations for designing cell-carrier biomaterial scaffolds. It also discusses current biomaterials used for scaffolds that provide permissive and instructive microenvironments for improved cell transplantation."
What is the potential of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells to successfully treat human spinal cord injury?,"Watson RA, Yeung TM.","AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinal cord injury is a serious and debilitating condition, affecting millions of people worldwide. Long seen as a permanent injury, recent advances in stem cell research have brought closer the possibility of repairing the spinal cord. One such approach involves injecting oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, derived from human embryonic stem cells, into the injured spinal cord in the hope that they will initiate repair. A phase I clinical trial of this therapy was started in mid 2010 and is currently underway. DISCUSSION: The theory underlying this approach is that these myelinating progenitors will phenotypically replace myelin lost during injury whilst helping to promote a repair environment in the lesion. However, the importance of demyelination in the pathogenesis of human spinal cord injury is a contentious issue and a body of literature suggests that it is only a minor factor in the overall injury process. SUMMARY: This review examines the validity of the theory underpinning the on-going clinical trial as well as analysing published data from animal models and finally discussing issues surrounding safety and purity in order to assess the potential of this approach to successfully treat acute human spinal cord injury."
Spinal motor neuron transplantation to enhance nerve reconstruction strategies: Towards a cell therapy,"Bazarek S, Johnston BR, Sten M, Mandeville R, Eggan K, Wainger BJ, Brown JM.","AB  - Human neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke, and spinal cord injury are caused by a loss of neurons and glial cells in the brain or spinal cord. Cell replacement therapy and gene transfer to the diseased or injured brain have provided the basis for the development of potentially powerful new therapeutic strategies for a broad spectrum of human neurological diseases. However, the paucity of suitable cell types for cell replacement therapy in patients suffering from neurological disorders has hampered the development of this promising therapeutic approach. In recent years, neurons and glial cells have successfully been generated from stem cells such as embryonic stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and neural stem cells, and extensive efforts by investigators to develop stem cell-based brain transplantation therapies have been carried out. We review here notable experimental and preclinical studies previously published involving stem cell-based cell and gene therapies for Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, ALS, Alzheimer's disease, MS, stroke, spinal cord injury, brain tumor, and lysosomal storage diseases and discuss the future prospects for stem cell therapy of neurological disorders in the clinical setting. There are still many obstacles to be overcome before clinical application of cell therapy in neurological disease patients is adopted: 1) it is still uncertain what kind of stem cells would be an ideal source for cellular grafts, and 2) the mechanism by which transplantation of stem cells leads to an enhanced functional recovery and structural reorganization must to be better understood. Steady and solid progress in stem cell research in both basic and preclinical settings should support the hope for development of stem cell-based cell therapies for neurological diseases."
Natural recovery and regeneration of the central nervous system,"Verma N, Fazioli A, Matijasich P.","AB  - Thanks to advances in the stem cell biology of the central nervous system, the previously unconceivable regeneration of the damaged spinal cord is approaching reality. A number of potential strategies aim to optimize functional recovery after spinal cord injury. They include minimizing the progression of secondary injury, manipulating the inhibitory environment of the spinal cord, replacing lost tissue with transplanted cells or peripheral nerve grafts, remyelinating denuded axons and maximizing the intrinsic regenerative potential of endogenous progenitor cells. We review the application of stem cell transplantation to the spinal cord, emphasizing the use of embryonic stem cells for remyelinating damaged axons. Recent advancements in neural injury and repair, and the progress towards development of neuroprotective and regenerative interventions are discussed."
On the Viability and Potential Value of Stem Cells for Repair and Treatment of Central Neurotrauma: Overview and Speculations,"Wu S, FitzGerald KT, Giordano J.","AB  - Oxidative stress has been implicated to play a role in a number of acute and chronic diseases including acute injuries of the central nervous system, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. The redox-activated transcription factor Nrf2 has been shown to protect many different cell types and organs from a variety of toxic insults, whereas in many cancers, unchecked Nrf2 activity increases the expression of cytoprotective genes and, consequently, provides growth advantage to cancerous cells. Herein, we discuss current preclinical gene therapy approaches to either increase or decrease Nrf2 activity with a special reference to neurological diseases and cancer. In addition, we discuss the role of Nrf2 in stem cell therapy for neurological disorders."
The use of stem cells for the treatment of spinal surgical conditions,"Aftab S, Chimutengwende-Gordon M, Malik A, Lee R.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a trauma problem striking mainly working age adults, therefore affecting society beyond the victims family circle. Most of the victims of SCI will never recover; therapy for this type of injury consists basically on spinal cord support and stabilization. With the discovery of stem cells (SC), SCI treatment has been given another chance. Stem cells are responsible for tissue renewal throughout the individuals life, as well as tissue repair when needed. From the therapeutic point of view, the most appealing SC are those capable of generating a variety of tissues, those easily harvested, and finally, those ethically unquestioned.

Stem cell-based approach for the treatment of Parkinson's disease,"Goodarzi P, Aghayan HR, Larijani B, Soleimani M, Dehpour AR, Sahebjam M, Ghaderi F, Arjmand B.","AB  - Stem cells possess great promise as therapeutic tools for neurological disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases (Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease), cerebrovascular diseases (stroke), neurotraumata (spinal cord injury) and demyelinating diseases (multiple sclerosis). This aspiration is based on the cells` ability to maintain a status of self-renewal and to differentiate into the various cell types of an organism. The use of the cells ranges from in vitro to in vivo studies in animal models, ending with clinical applications in humans. The self-renewal and commitment of stem/progenitor cells to differentiate and mature involves complex events leading to the generation of different phenotypes via distinctive developmental programs. Small molecules provide a tool with which to influence these regulatory changes in a controlled manner and to help understand the underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, substantial progress in generating induced pluripotent stem cells has been made using small molecules to replace reprogramming factors and enhance the reprogramming efficiency and kinetics, thus generating cells more compatible with the requirements for cell replacement therapies. In this review we will present the recent progress on the use of small molecules in embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cell research. In the final section we will give a short summary of the clinical approaches using these cells."
Stem cells in veterinary medicine,"Fortier LA, Travis AJ.","AB  - The research in stem cells gives a proper information about basic mechanisms of human development and differentiation. The use of stem cells in new medicinal therapies includes treatment of different conditions such as spinal cord injury, diabetes mellitus, Parkinsonism, and cardiac disorders. These cells exhibit two unique properties: self-renewal and differentiation. The major stem cells been used for approximately about 10-14 years for cellular therapy are mesenchymal stem cells. Mesenchymal stem cells can individualize into many lineage, i.e. into both mesenchymal and non-mesenchymal lineage, such as into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, myocytes, adipocytes, neurons, etc. This review focuses on the history, types of stem cells and their targets and mechanisms of mesenchymal stem cells. Mesenchymal stem cells are the significant futuristic carrier for treating diseases associated not only with regeneration but also immunomodulation."
"Matrices, scaffolds & carriers for cell delivery in nerve regeneration","Wang ZZ, Sakiyama-Elbert SE.","AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative brain disorder which is around 1.5 times more common in men than in women. Currently, drug medications, surgery, and lifestyle changes are common approaches to PD, while all of them focused on reducing the symptoms. Therefore, regenerative medicine based on stem cell (SC) therapies has raised a promising hope. Various types of SCs have been used in basic and experimental studies relevant to PD, including embryonic pluripotential stem cells, mesenchymal (MSCs) and induced pluripotent SCs (iPSCs). MSCs have several advantages over other counterparts. They are easily accessible which can be obtained from various tissues such as bone marrow, adipose tissue, peripheral blood, etc. with avoiding ethical problems. Therefore, MSCs is attractive clinically because there are no related ethical and immunological concerns . Further studies are needed to answer some crucial questions about the different issues in SC therapy. Accordingly, SC-based therapy for PD also needed more complementary evaluation in both basic and clinical study areas."

Traumatic injuries to the central nervous system (CNS) trigger intricate pathophysiological responses, frequently leading to profound and enduring disabilities. This article delves into the dual phases of injury-primary impacts and the subsequent secondary biochemical cascades-that worsen initial damage. Conventional treatments have traditionally prioritized immediate stabilization, surgical interventions, and supportive medical care to manage both the primary and secondary damage associated with central nervous system injuries. We explore current surgical and medical management strategies, emphasizing the crucial role of rehabilitation and the promising potential of stem cell therapies and immune modulation. Advances in stem cell therapy, gene editing, and neuroprosthetics are revolutionizing treatment approaches, providing opportunities not just for recovery but also for the regeneration of impaired neural tissues.

Stem cell-based cell therapy in neurological diseases: a review,"Kim SU, de Vellis J.","AB  - Nerve transfers have become a powerful intervention to restore function following devastating paralyzing injuries. A major limitation to peripheral nerve repair and reconstructive strategies is the progressive, fibrotic degeneration of the distal nerve and denervated muscle, eventually precluding recovery of these targets and thus defining a time window within which reinnervation must occur. One proven strategy in the clinic has been the sacrifice and transfer of an adjacent distal motor nerve to provide axons to occupy, and thus preserve (or babysit"")"

This review focuses on recent advances and controversies regarding the applications of stem cells in spinal fusion surgery, spinal cord injury and intervertebral disc degeneration. There are significant concerns regarding the ethics and risks of stem cell use. Animal models do not always accurately depict the human condition. While a great deal has been achieved, successful translation into clinical practice is needed. However there is no doubt that stem cells have a major role to play in the future management of spinal conditions."
Progress in stem cell therapy for major human neurological disorders,"Martínez-Morales PL, Revilla A, Ocaña I, González C, Sainz P, McGuire D, Liste I.","AB  - Chronic tissue and organ failure caused by an injury, disease, ageing or congenital defects represents some of the most complex therapeutic challenges and poses a significant financial healthcare burden. Regenerative medicine strategies aim to fulfil the unmet clinical need by restoring the normal tissue function either through stimulating the endogenous tissue repair or by using transplantation strategies to replace the missing or defective cells. Stem cells represent an essential pillar of regenerative medicine efforts as they provide a source of progenitors or differentiated cells for use in cell replacement therapies. Whilst significant leaps have been made in controlling the stem cell fates and differentiating them to cell types of interest, transitioning bespoke cellular products from an academic environment to off-the-shelf clinical treatments brings about a whole new set of challenges which encompass manufacturing, regulatory and funding issues. Notwithstanding the need to resolve such issues before cell replacement therapies can benefit global healthcare, mounting progress in the field has highlighted regenerative medicine as a realistic prospect for treating some of the previously incurable conditions."
Regenerative Medicine: Advances from Developmental to Degenerative Diseases,"Blair NF, Frith TJR, Barbaric I.","AB  - The diagnosis and management of CNS injuries comprises a large portion of psychiatric practice. Many clinical and preclinical studies have demonstrated the benefit of treating CNS injuries using various regenerative techniques and materials such as stem cells, biomaterials and genetic modification. Therefore it is the goal of this review article to briefly summarize the pathogenesis of CNS injuries, including traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord injuries and cerebrovascular accidents. Next, we discuss the role of natural recovery and regeneration of the CNS, explore the relevance in clinical practice and discuss emerging and cutting-edge treatments and current barriers in the field of regenerative medicine."
Dental stem cells and their promising role in neural regeneration: an update,"Martens W, Bronckaers A, Politis C, Jacobs R, Lambrichts I.","AB  - Stem cells are undifferentiated cells with the ability of proliferation, regeneration, conversion to differentiated cells and producing various tissues. Stem cells are divided into two categories of embryonic and adult. In another categorization stem cells are divided to Totipotent, Multipotent and Unipotent cells.So far usage of stem cells in treatment of various blood diseases has been studied (such as lymphoblastic leukemia, myeloid leukemia, thalassemia, multiple myeloma and cycle cell anemia). In this paper the goal is evaluation of cell therapy in treatment of Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer, Stroke, Spinal Cord Injury, Multiple Sclerosis, Radiation Induced Intestinal Injury, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Liver Disease, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Diabetes, Heart Disease, Bone Disease, Renal Disease, Chronic Wounds, Graft-Versus-Host Disease, Sepsis and Respiratory diseases. It should be mentioned that some disease that are the target of cell therapy are discussed in this article."
Cytotherapy using stromal cells: Current and advance multi-treatment approaches,"Shende P, Gupta H, Gaud RS.","AB  - Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells have been investigated for many years, especially for tissue regeneration, and have inherent limitations. One of the rapidly developing fields in the scientific world in recent years is extracellular vesicles. Especially, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell originated extracellular vesicles are known to have positive contributions in tissue regeneration, and these extracellular vesicles have also been used as gene transfer systems for cellular therapy. Through gene expression analysis and bioinformatics tools, it is possible to determine which genes have changed in the targeted tissue or cell and which miRNAs that can correct this gene expression disorder. This approach connecting the stem cell, extracellular vesicles, epigenetics regulation and bioinformatics fields is one of the promising areas for the treatment of diseases in the future. With this review, it is aimed to present the studies carried out for the use of bone marrow stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles loaded with targeted miRNAs in different in vivo and in vitro human disease models and to discuss recent developments in this field."
[Status and application prospect in repair of spinal cord injury by stem cells],"Wang L, Wang J, Lu K.","AB  - Epilepsy as one of the most common neurological disorders affects more than 50 million people worldwide with a higher prevalence rate in low-income countries. Excessive electrical discharges in neurons following neural cell damage or loss cause recurrent seizures. One of the most common and difficult to treat types of epilepsy is temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) which results from hippocampal sclerosis. Nowadays, similar to other diseases, epilepsy also is a candidate for treatment with different types of stem cells. Various stem cell types were used for treatment of epilepsy in basic and experimental researches. Two major roles of stem cell therapy in epilepsy are prophylaxis against chronic epilepsy and amelioration cognitive function after the occurrence of TLE. Several animal studies have supported the use of these cells for treating drug-resistant TLE. Although stem cell therapy seems like a promising approach for treatment of epilepsy in the future however, there are some serious safety and ethical concerns that are needed to be eliminated before clinical application."
The Multiple Roles of FGF Signaling in the Developing Spinal Cord,"Diez Del Corral R, Morales AV.","AB  - The stem cell field in veterinary medicine continues to evolve rapidly both experimentally and clinically. Stem cells are most commonly used in clinical veterinary medicine in therapeutic applications for the treatment of musculoskeletal injuries in horses and dogs. New technologies of assisted reproduction are being developed to apply the properties of spermatogonial stem cells to preserve endangered animal species. The same methods can be used to generate transgenic animals for production of pharmaceuticals or for use as biomedical models. Small and large animal species serve as valuable models for preclinical evaluation of stem cell applications in human beings and in veterinary patients in areas such as spinal cord injury and myocardial infarction. However, these applications have not been implemented in the clinical treatment of veterinary patients. Reviews on the use of animal models for stem cell research have been published recently. Therefore, in this review, animal model research will be reviewed only in the context of supporting the current clinical application of stem cells in veterinary medicine."
Preclinical Experimental Applications of miRNA Loaded BMSC Extracellular Vesicles,"Cetin Z, Saygili EI, Görgisen G, Sokullu E.","AB  - During vertebrate embryonic development, the spinal cord is formed by the neural derivatives of a neuromesodermal population that is specified at early stages of development and which develops in concert with the caudal regression of the primitive streak. Several processes related to spinal cord specification and maturation are coupled to this caudal extension including neurogenesis, ventral patterning and neural crest specification and all of them seem to be crucially regulated by Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signaling, which is prominently active in the neuromesodermal region and transiently in its derivatives. Here we review the role of FGF signaling in those processes, trying to separate its different functions and highlighting the interactions with other signaling pathways. Finally, these early functions of FGF signaling in spinal cord development may underlay partly its ability to promote regeneration in the lesioned spinal cord as well as its action promoting specific fates in neural stem cell cultures that may be used for therapeutical purposes."
Stem cell therapy in treatment of different diseases,"Larijani B, Esfahani EN, Amini P, Nikbin B, Alimoghaddam K, Amiri S, Malekzadeh R, Yazdi NM, Ghodsi M, Dowlati Y, Sahraian MA, Ghavamzadeh A.","AB  - Human neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, stroke or spinal cord injury are caused by the loss of neurons and glial cells in the brain or spinal cord in the Central Nervous System (CNS). Stem cell technology has become an attractive option to investigate and treat these diseases. Several types of neurons and glial cells have successfully been generated from stem cells, which in some cases, have ameliorated some dysfunctions both in animal models of neurological disorders and in patients at clinical level. Stem cell-based therapies can be beneficial by acting through several mechanisms such as cell replacement, modulation of inflammation and trophic actions. Here we review recent and current remarkable clinical studies involving stem cell-based therapy for AD and stroke and provide an overview of the different types of stem cells available nowadays, their main properties and how they are developing as a possible therapy for neurological disorders."
Stem cell transplantation in neurological diseases: improving effectiveness in animal models,"Adami R, Scesa G, Bottai D.","AB  - Stem cells are considered to have significant capacity to differentiate into various cell types in humans and animals. Unlike specialized cells, these cells can proliferate several times to produce millions of cells. Nowadays, pluripotent stem cells are important candidates to provide a renewable source for the replacement of cells in tissues of interest. The damage to neurons and glial cells in the brain or spinal cord is present in neurological disorders such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, spinal cord injury, lysosomal storage disorder, epilepsy, and glioblastoma. Therefore, stem cell transplantation can be used as a novel therapeutic approach in cases of brain and spinal cord damage. Recently, researchers have generated neuron-like cells and glial-like cells from embryonic stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and neural stem cells. In addition, several experimental studies have been performed for developing stem cell transplantation in brain tissue. Herein, we focus on stem cell therapy to regenerate injured tissue resulting from neurological diseases and then discuss possible differentiation pathways of stem cells to the renewal of neurons."
Transplantation of Stem Cells as a Potential Therapeutic Strategy in Neurodegenerative Disorders,"Ebrahimi T, Abasi M, Seifar F, Eyvazi S, Hejazi MS, Tarhriz V, Montazersaheb S.","AB  - INTRODUCTION: Stem cell-based therapies are considered to be a promising treatment method for several clinical conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury, and many others. However, the ideal stem cell type for stem cell-based therapy remains to be elucidated. DISCUSSION: Stem cells are present in a variety of tissues in the embryonic and adult human body. Both embryonic and adult stem cells have their advantages and disadvantages concerning the isolation method, ethical issues, or differentiation potential. The most described adult stem cell population is the mesenchymal stem cells due to their multi-lineage (trans)differentiation potential, high proliferative capacity, and promising therapeutic values. Recently, five different cell populations with mesenchymal stem cell characteristics were identified in dental tissues: dental pulp stem cells, stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth, periodontal ligament stem cells, dental follicle precursor cells, and stem cells from apical papilla. CONCLUSION: Each dental stem cell population possesses specific characteristics and advantages which will be summarized in this review. Furthermore, the neural characteristics of dental pulp stem cells and their potential role in (peripheral) neural regeneration will be discussed."
Cell replacement therapy for central nervous system diseases,"Tso D, McKinnon RD.","AB  - Fetal neural progenitor grafts have been evaluated in preclinical animal models of spinal cord injury and Parkinson's disease for decades, but the initial reliance on primary tissue as a cell source limited the scale of their clinical translatability. With the development of robust methods to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells to specific neural subtypes, cell replacement therapy holds renewed promise to treat a variety of neurodegenerative diseases and injuries at scale. As these cell sources are evaluated in preclinical models, new transsynaptic tracing methods are making it possible to study the connectivity between host and graft neurons with greater speed and detail than was previously possible. To date, these studies have revealed that widespread, long-lasting, and anatomically appropriate synaptic contacts are established between host and graft neurons, as well as new aspects of host-graft connectivity which may be relevant to clinical cell replacement therapy. It is not yet clear, however, whether the synaptic connectivity between graft and host neurons is as cell-type specific as it is in the endogenous nervous system, or whether that connectivity is responsible for the functional efficacy of cell replacement therapy. Here, we review evidence suggesting that the new contacts established between host and graft neurons may indeed be cell-type specific, and how transsynaptic tracing can be used in the future to further elucidate the mechanisms of graft-mediated functional recovery in spinal cord injury and Parkinson's disease."
New Insights Into Human Hyaluronidase 4/Chondroitin Sulphate Hydrolase,Maciej-Hulme ML.,"AB  - In this review, the current experimental evidence, literature and hypotheses surrounding hyaluronidase 4 [HYAL4, also known as chondroitin sulphate hydrolase (CHSE)] and chondroitin sulphate (CS) are explored. Originally named for its sequence similarity to other members of the hyaluronidase family, HYAL4 is actually a relatively distinct member of the family, particularly for its unique degradation of CS-D (2-O-, 6-O-sulphated CS) motifs and specific expression. Human HYAL4 protein expression and structural features are discussed in relation to different isoforms, activities, potential localisations and protein-protein interaction partners. CS proteoglycan targets of HYAL4 activity include: serglycin, aggrecan, CD44 and sulfatase 2, with other potential proteoglycans yet to be identified. Importantly, changes in HYAL4 expression changes in human disease have been described for testicular, bladder and kidney cancers, with gene mutations reported for several others including: leukaemia, endometrial, ovarian, colorectal, head and neck, stomach, lung and breast cancers. The HYAL4 gene also plays a role in P53 negative human cancer cell proliferation and is linked to stem cell naivety. However, its role in cancer remains relatively unexplored. Finally, current tools and techniques for the detection of specific HYAL4 activity in biological samples are critically assessed. Understanding the role of HYAL4 in human diseases will fortify our understanding of developmental processes and disease manifestation, ultimately providing novel diagnostic opportunities and therapeutic targets for drug discovery."
Transsynaptic tracing and its emerging use to assess graft-reconstructed neural circuits,"Adler AF, Björklund A, Parmar M.","AB  - Gene therapy is an innovative approach in the field of regenerative medicine. This therapy entails the transfer of genetic material into a patient's cells to treat diseases. In particular, gene therapy for neurological diseases has recently achieved significant progress, with numerous studies investigating the use of adeno-associated viruses for the targeted delivery of therapeutic genetic fragments. This approach has potential applications for treating incurable diseases, including paralysis and motor impairment caused by spinal cord injury and Parkinson's disease, and it is characterized by dopaminergic neuron degeneration. Recently, several studies have explored the potential of direct lineage reprogramming (DLR) for treating incurable diseases, and highlighted the advantages of DLR over conventional stem cell therapy. However, application of DLR technology in clinical practice is hindered by its low efficiency compared with cell therapy using stem cell differentiation. To overcome this limitation, researchers have explored various strategies such as the efficiency of DLR. In this study, we focused on innovative strategies, including the use of a nanoporous particle-based gene delivery system to improve the reprogramming efficiency of DLR-induced neurons. We believe that discussing these approaches can facilitate the development of more effective gene therapies for neurological disorders."
The use of stem cells' hematopoietic stimulating factors therapy following spinal cord injury,"Divani AA, Hussain MS, Magal E, Heary RF, Qureshi AI.","AB  - There is currently no treatment for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's diseases. While spinal cord injury has no treatment either, nerve injuries are being treated with autologous grafts, a procedure that in turn translates into a loss of function in the donor area. The development of therapies for these pathologies has become urgent as population keeps on ageing. A promising direction of investigation is the use of regenerative techniques to re-grow healthy and functional tissue in the injured area. In this review article, various approaches currently investigated to promote neural regeneration are covered. Those include approaches based on (and many times combining) stem cell therapy, scaffolds made of hydrogel, electrospun fibers and conductive materials as well as the use of soluble or non-diffusible growth factors."
Cell transplantation: stem cells and precursor cells,"Cao Q, Whittemore SR.","AB  - Stem cells have been used to approach four different therapeutic repair strategies in spinal cord injury (SCI): (1) replacement of lost neurons, (2) replacement of oligodendrocytes to promote remyelination of demyelinated and/or regenerated axons, (3) providing a permissive substrate for axonal regeneration to overcome the intrinsic inhibition of surface molecules, and (4) engendering host repair. The first two strategies involve cell-specific differentiation of engrafted neural cells and the latter two may involve grafted neural or non-neural cells. The preclinical data for all of these approaches is at times contradictory and there is no consensus as to what type of stem cell is optimal to facilitate repair in specific injuries. Remyelination has been the most successful stem cell replacement strategy. Partial lineage restriction and pharmacological and/or genetic manipulation to express additional trophic support or restrict responses to host signals appears necessary for optimal neuronal and oligodendrocytic differentiation. However, these modifications will make their clinical application exceedingly difficult. Effects of grafted stem cells on abrogating host immune responses and engendering intrinsic repair is also a mechanism through which stem cells are likely therapeutically beneficial. While clinical trials with stem cell grafting into the injured spinal cord are ongoing, preclinical studies have yet to define mechanisms of action that can be definitively translated to those clinical approaches."
Cell-based therapy approaches: the hope for incurable diseases,"Buzhor E, Leshansky L, Blumenthal J, Barash H, Warshawsky D, Mazor Y, Shtrichman R.","AB  - Nowadays, scientific findings in the field of regeneration of nervous system have revealed the possibility of stem cell based therapies for damaged brain tissue related disorders like stroke. Furthermore, to achieve desirable outcomes from cellular therapies, one needs to monitor the migration, engraftment, viability, and also functional fate of transplanted stem cells. Magnetic resonance imaging is an extremely versatile technique for this purpose, which has been broadly used to study stroke and assessment of therapeutic role of stem cells.

From mice to mind: Strategies and progress in translating neuroregeneration,"Burns TC, Verfaillie CM.","AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases are caused by a loss of neurons within the peripheral or central nervous system. Inadequate repairability in the central nervous system and failure of treatments are the significant hurdles for several neurological diseases. The regenerative potential of stem cells drew the attention of researchers to cell-based therapy for treating neurodegenerative diseases. The clinical application of stem cells may help to substitute new cells and overcome the inability of the endogenous repairing system to repair the damaged brain. However, the clinical application induced pluripotent stem cells are restricted due to the risk of tumor formation by residual undifferentiated upon transplantation. In this focused review, we briefly discussed different stem cells currently being studied for therapeutic development. Moreover, we present supporting evidence for the utilization of stem cell therapy for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Also, we described the key issues that should be considered to transplantation of stem cells for different neurodegenerative diseases. In our conclusion, stem cell therapy probably would be the only treatment strategy that offers a cure for neurodegenerative disease. Although, further study is required to identify ideal stem cells candidate, dosing and the ideal method of cell transplantation. We suggest that all grafted cells would be transgenically armed with a molecular kill-switch that could be activated by the event of adverse side effects."
Stem cells: therapeutic present and future,Khurdayan VK.,"AB  - Until relatively recently, we thought that the human central nervous system (CNS) was unable to regenerate. However, with the initial discovery of remyelination within the brain and the spinal cord in cat (Bunge, Bunge and Ris. Ultrastructural study of remyelination in an experimental lesion in adult cat spinal cord. J Biophys Biochem Cytol 1961;10:67-94.) and later in human (Prineas and Connell. Remyelination in multiple sclerosis. Ann Neurol 1979;5:22-31.), we know that regeneration can be quite extensive. This review will concentrate on CNS remyelination, indicating why it is important for various human neurodegenerative diseases including multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury, and relate how stem cells may be involved--both in endogenous repair and in proposed therapies."
Therapeutic potential of stem cells for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases,"Ahmadian-Moghadam H, Sadat-Shirazi MS, Zarrindast MR.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) remains one of the most devastating conditions in medicine, particularly due to the loss of productive life years and the high economic burden it places on our society. There are limited therapeutic options available to reduce the morbidity and mortality related to SCI. However, recent work with stem cells in repairing SCI appears to be promising, making this one of the most exciting frontiers in medicine. A brief review of the mechanisms of SCI is presented. Stem cells from a variety of sources have shown effectiveness in improving motor function after SCI in animals. The pre-clinical use of stem cells in SCI and methods of delivery are discussed. The potential use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to increase the number of stem cells engrafting at the site of injury in order to improve neurological and motor function recovery following SCI is introduced. G-CSF, through stimulation of lymphohemopoietic stem cells in peripheral blood, can potentially cause repopulation of the SCI region with neural progenitor cells. This allows for improved functional outcomes. More pre-clinical and translational research exploring this possibility is required."
PET molecular imaging in stem cell therapy for neurological diseases,"Wang J, Tian M, Zhang H.","AB  - The brain and spinal cord can not replace neurons or supporting glia that are lost through traumatic injury or disease. In pre-clinical studies, however, neural stem and progenitor cell transplants can promote functional recovery. Thus the central nervous system is repair competent but lacks endogenous stem cell resources. To make transplants clinically feasible, this field needs a source of histocompatible, ethically acceptable and non-tumorgenic cells. One strategy to generate patient-specific replacement cells is to reprogram autologous cells such as fibroblasts into pluripotent stem cells which can then be differentiated into the required cell grafts. However, the utility of pluripotent cell derived grafts is limited since they can retain founder cells with intrinsic neoplastic potential. A recent extension of this technology directly reprograms fibroblasts into the final graftable cells without an induced pluripotent stem cell intermediate, avoiding the pluripotent caveat. For both types of reprogramming the conversion efficiency is very low resulting in the need to amplify the cells in culture which can lead to chromosomal instability and neoplasia. Thus to make reprogramming biology clinically feasible, we must improve the efficiency. The ultimate source of replacement cells may reside in directly reprogramming accessible cells within the brain."
Gene Therapy Using Efficient Direct Lineage Reprogramming Technology for Neurological Diseases,"Chang Y, Lee S, Kim J, Kim C, Shim HS, Lee SE, Park HJ, Kim J, Lee S, Lee YK, Park S, Yoo J.","AB  - Ever since the first embryonic stem cells were isolated in the 1990s scientists and clinicians as well as the general public have followed the development of the field with great attention. As unspecialized cells capable of dividing, renewing and differentiating into specialized cells, stem cells hold great promise as a therapeutic strategy for many diseases, especially those of degenerative nature. In 2006, stem cells were actively investigated in preclinical and clinical settings to manage heart failure, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal cord injury, stroke, hematologic disorders, renal cell carcinoma, solid tumor cancer, Crohn's disease and cirrhosis, among other disorders. Likewise, biotech and pharmaceutical industry highlighted stem cells and associated products and technologies as useful tools for drug discovery that provide relevant clinical models and ensure efficacious transition of investigational compounds into preclinical testing."
Translating stem cell therapies to the clinic,"Miller RH, Bai L.","AB  - One of the most remarkable advances in translational neuroscience of the last few years has been the emergence of cell-based approaches for a wide range of neurological disease and injuries.

"Biological restoration of central nervous system architecture and function: part 3-stem cell- and cell-based applications and realities in the biological management of central nervous system disorders: traumatic, vascular, and epilepsy disorders","Farin A, Liu CY, Langmoen IA, Apuzzo ML.","AB  - Neurological diseases afflict a growing proportion of the human population. There are two reasons for this: first, the average age of the population (especially in the industrialized world) is increasing, and second, the diagnostic tools to detect these pathologies are now more sophisticated and can be used on a higher percentage of the population. In many cases, neurological disease has a pharmacological treatment which, as in the case of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Epilepsy, and Multiple Sclerosis can reduce the symptoms and slow down the course of the disease but cannot reverse its effects or heal the patient. In the last two decades the transplantation approach, by means of stem cells of different origin, has been suggested for the treatment of neurological diseases. The choice of slightly different animal models and the differences in methods of stem cell preparation make it difficult to compare the results of transplantation experiments. Moreover, the translation of these results into clinical trials with human subjects is difficult and has so far met with little success. This review seeks to discuss the reasons for these difficulties by considering the differences between human and animal cells (including isolation, handling and transplantation) and between the human disease model and the animal disease model."
Regenerative medicine for neurological disorders,"Park DH, Eve DJ, Chung YG, Sanberg PR.","AB  - STEM CELL THERAPY has emerged as a promising novel therapeutic endeavor for traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, stroke, and epilepsy in experimental studies. A few preliminary clinical trials have further supported its safety and early efficacy after transplantation into humans. Although not yet clinically available for central nervous system disorders, stem cell technology is expected to evolve into one of the most powerful tools in the biological management of complex central nervous system disorders, many of which currently have limited treatment modalities. The identification of stem cells, discovery of neurogenesis, and application of stem cells to treat central nervous system disorders represent a dramatic evolution and expansion of the neurosurgeon's capabilities into the neurorestoration and neuroregeneration realms. In Part 3 of a 5-part series on stem cells, we discuss the theory, experimental evidence, and clinical data pertaining to the use of stem cells for the treatment of traumatic, vascular, and epileptic disorders."
Fractone Stem Cell Niche Components Provide Intuitive Clues in the Design of New Therapeutic Procedures/Biomatrices for Neural Repair,Melrose J.,"AB  - Decisions about what experimental therapies are advanced to clinical trials are based almost exclusively on findings in preclinical animal studies. Over the past 30 years, animal models have forecast the success of hundreds of neuroprotective pharmacological therapies for stroke, Alzheimer׳s disease, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Yet almost without exception, all have failed. Rapid advances in stem cell technologies have raised new hopes that these neurological diseases may one day be treatable. Still, how can neuroregenerative therapies be translated into clinical realities if available animal models are such poor surrogates of human disease? To address this question we discuss human and rodent neurogenesis, evaluate mechanisms of action for cellular therapies and describe progress in translating neuroregeneration to date. We conclude that not only are appropriate animal models critical to the development of safe and effective therapies, but that the multiple mechanisms of stem cell-mediated therapies may be particularly well suited to the mechanistically diverse nature of central nervous system diseases in mice and man."
Conditioned Medium Treatment for the Improvement of Functional Recovery after Spinal Cord Injury: A Meta-Analysis Study,"Hajisoltani R, Taghizadeh M, Hamblin MR, Ramezani F.","AB  - Clinicians and scientists in the field of spinal cord injury research and medicine are poised to begin translating promising new experimental findings into treatments for people. Advances in experimental regeneration research have led to several transplantation strategies that promote axonal regrowth and partial functional recovery in animal models of injury. In this review, we summarize current knowledge regarding various invasive experimental treatments that have been or are now being applied clinically. Various questions about the timeliness, safety, and benefits of the procedures are under discussion within the spinal cord injury (SCI) research community. We also describe guidelines for carrying out optimal clinical trials and efforts to establish specific international guidelines to translate preclinical treatment strategies into clinical trials in SCI. The clinical trial process and the role that clinical professionals have in advising individuals regarding participation in experimental procedures also is discussed."
An appraisal of ongoing experimental procedures in human spinal cord injury,"Amador MJ, Guest JD.","AB  - Human neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis are caused by loss of different types of neurons and glial cells in the brain and spinal cord. At present, there are no effective therapies against these disorders. Discovery of the therapeutic potential of stem cells offers new strategies for the treatment of neurological diseases. Direct assessment of stem cells' survival, interaction with the host and impact on neuronal functions after transplantation requires advanced in vivo imaging techniques. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a potential molecular imaging modality to evaluate the viability and function of transplanted tissue or stem cells in the nervous system. This review focuses on PET molecular imaging in stem cell therapy for neurological diseases."
[Transplantation of neural stem cells for spinal cord injury],"Nakamura M, Toyama Y, Okano H.","AB  - Neural progenitor cells, including neural stem cells (NSCs), are an important potential graft material for cell therapeutics of damaged spinal cord. Here we used as a source of graft material a NSC-enriched population derived from human fetal spinal cord (Embryonic week 8-9) and expanded in vitro by neurosphere formation. NSCs labeled with BrdU (TP) or culture medium (CON) were transplanted into the adult marmoset spinal cord after contusion injury at C5 level. Grafted NSCs survived and migrated up to 7 mm far from the lesion epicenter. Double-staining with TuJ1 for neuron, GFAP for astrocyte, or CNPase for oligodendrocyte and BrdU revealed that grafted NSCs differentiated into neurons and oligodendrocytes 8 weeks after transplantation. More neurofilaments were observed in TP than those of CON. Furthermore, behavioral assessment of forelimb muscle strength using bar grip test and amount of spontaneous motor activity using infrared-rays monitoring revealed that the grafted NSCs significantly increased both of them compared to those of CON. These results indicate that in vitro expanded NSCs derived from human fetal spinal cord are useful sources for the therapeutics of spinal cord injury in primates."
[Neural repair],"Kitada M, Dezawa M.","AB  - The annual meeting of the American Society for Neural Therapy and Repair (ASNTR) has always introduced us to top-notch and up-to-date approaches for regenerative medicine related to neuroscience, ranging from stem cell-based therapy to novel drugs. The 16th ASNTR meeting focused on a variety of different topics, including the unknown pathogenesis or mechanisms of specific neurodegenerative diseases, stem cell biology, and development of novel alternative medicines or devices. Newly developed stem cells, such as amniotic epithelial stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, as well as well-known traditional stem cells, such as neural, embryonic, bone marrow mesenchymal, and human umbilical cord blood-derived stem cells, were reported. A number of commercialized stem cells were also covered at this meeting. Fetal neural tissues, such as ventral mesencephalon, striatum, and Schwann cells, were investigated for neurodegenerative diseases or spinal cord injury. A number of studies focused on novel methods for drug monitoring or graft tracking, and combination therapy with stem cells and medicine, such as cytokines or trophic factors. Finally, the National Institutes of Health guidelines for human stem cell research, clinical trials of commercialized stem cells without larger animal testing, and prohibition of medical tourism were big controversial issues that led to heated discussion."
Stem cells in neurology--current perspectives,"Batista CE, Mariano ED, Marie SK, Teixeira MJ, Morgalla M, Tatagiba M, Li J, Lepski G.","AB  - The aim of this study was to illustrate recent developments in neural repair utilizing hyaluronan as a carrier of olfactory bulb stem cells and in new bioscaffolds to promote neural repair. Hyaluronan interacts with brain hyalectan proteoglycans in protective structures around neurons in perineuronal nets, which also have roles in the synaptic plasticity and development of neuronal cognitive properties. Specialist stem cell niches termed fractones located in the sub-ventricular and sub-granular regions of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus migrate to the olfactory bulb, which acts as a reserve of neuroprogenitor cells in the adult brain. The extracellular matrix associated with the fractone stem cell niche contains hyaluronan, perlecan and laminin α5, which regulate the quiescent recycling of stem cells and also provide a means of escaping to undergo the proliferation and differentiation to a pluripotent migratory progenitor cell type that can participate in repair processes in neural tissues. Significant improvement in the repair of spinal cord injury and brain trauma has been reported using this approach. FGF-2 sequestered by perlecan in the neuroprogenitor niche environment aids in these processes. Therapeutic procedures have been developed using olfactory ensheathing stem cells and hyaluronan as a carrier to promote neural repair processes. Now that recombinant perlecan domain I and domain V are available, strategies may also be expected in the near future using these to further promote neural repair strategies."
Epidermal stem cells in orthopaedic regenerative medicine,"Li J, Zhen G, Tsai SY, Jia X.","AB  - Affecting young people during the most productive period of their lives, spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating problem for modern society. In the past, treating SCI seemed frustrating and hopeless because of the tremendous morbidity and mortality, life-shattering impact, and limited therapeutic options associated with the condition. Today, however, an understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, the development of neuroprotective interventions, and progress toward regenerative interventions are increasing hope for functional restoration. In this chapter, we provide an overview of various repair strategies for the injured spinal cord. Special attention will be paid to strategies that promote spontaneous regeneration, including functional electrical stimulation, cell replacement, neuroprotection, and remyelination. The concept that limited rebuilding can provide a disproportionate improvement in quality of life is emphasized throughout. New surgical procedures, pharmacological treatments, and functional neuromuscular stimulation methods have evolved over the last decades and can improve functional outcomes after spinal cord injury; however, limiting secondary injury remains the primary goal. Tissue replacement strategies, including the use of embryonic stem cells, become an important tool and can restore function in animal models. Controlled clinical trials are now required to confirm these observations. The ultimate goal is to harness the body's own potential to replace lost central nervous system cells by activation of endogenous progenitor cell repair mechanisms."
Approaches to repairing the damaged spinal cord: overview,"Becker D, McDonald JW 3rd.","AB  - Recent progress of stem cell biology gives us the hope for neural repair. We have established methods to specifically induce functional Schwann cells and neurons from bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs). The effectiveness of these induced cells was evaluated by grafting them either into peripheral nerve injury, spinal cord injury, or Parkinson' s disease animal models. MSCs-derived Schwann cells supported axonal regeneration and re-constructed myelin to facilitate the functional recovery in peripheral and spinal cord injury. MSCs-derived dopaminergic neurons integrated into host striatum and contributed to behavioral repair. In this review, we introduce the differentiation potential of MSCs and finally discuss about their benefits and drawbacks of these induction systems for cell-based therapy in neuro-traumatic and neuro-degenerative diseases."
Electrical Stimulation Elicits Neural Stem Cells Activation: New Perspectives in CNS Repair,"Huang Y, Li Y, Chen J, Zhou H, Tan S.","AB  - Cell therapies aim to repair the mechanisms underlying disease initiation and progression, achieved through trophic effect or by cell replacement. Multiple cell types can be utilized in such therapies, including stem, progenitor or primary cells. This review covers the current state of cell therapies designed for the prominent disorders, including cardiovascular, neurological (Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, spinal cord injury), autoimmune (Type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease), ophthalmologic, renal, liver and skeletal (osteoarthritis) diseases. Various cell therapies have reached advanced clinical trial phases with potential marketing approvals in the near future, many of which are based on mesenchymal stem cells. Advances in pluripotent stem cell research hold great promise for regenerative medicine. The information presented in this review is based on the analysis of the cell therapy collection detailed in LifeMap Discovery(®) (LifeMap Sciences Inc., USA) the database of embryonic development, stem cell research and regenerative medicine."
[Transplantation of neural stem cells and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in treatment of spinal cord injury],Xu C.,"AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the progress in the treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI) by graft of neural stem cells (NSCs) or bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) as well as immune characteristics of two stem cells. METHODS: Different kinds of documents were widely collected, and then immunologic characteristics of NSCs and BMSCs were summarized. The therapy of SCI by stem cell transplantation was reviewed. Additionally, some problems in treatment were analyzed. RESULTS: Experimental study showed that graft of NSCs and BMSCs can promote the functional recovery of the injured spinal cord in animals. Due to immunologic properties of two stem cells, rejection reaction of transplantation could produce a harmful effect on SCI treatment. CONCLUSION: Transplantation of NSCs or BMSCs might be an effective measure for SCI treatment, but immunologic rejection reaction must be considered."
Regulatory systems in bone marrow for hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells mobilization and homing,"Alvarez P, Carrillo E, Vélez C, Hita-Contreras F, Martínez-Amat A, Rodríguez-Serrano F, Boulaiz H, Ortiz R, Melguizo C, Prados J, Aránega A.","AB  - In the last decade, great advances have been made in epidermal stem cell studies at the cellular and molecular level. These studies reported various subpopulations and differentiations existing in the epidermal stem cell. Although controversies and unknown issues remain, epidermal stem cells possess an immune-privileged property in transplantation together with easy accessibility, which is favorable for future clinical application. In this review, we will summarize the biological characteristics of epidermal stem cells, and their potential in orthopedic regenerative medicine. Epidermal stem cells play a critical role via cell replacement, and demonstrate significant translational potential in the treatment of orthopedic injuries and diseases, including treatment for wound healing, peripheral nerve and spinal cord injury, and even muscle and bone remodeling."
A meta-analysis of the motion function through the therapy of spinal cord injury with intravenous transplantation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in rats,"Zhang D, He X.","AB  - The first human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line was developed in the late nineties. hESCs are capable of proliferating indefinitely and differentiate into all the three embryonic germ layers. Further, the differentiation of hESC lines into neural precursor cells and neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes showed their potential in treating several incurable neurological disorders such as spinal cord injury (SCI), cerebral palsy (CP), Parkinson's disease (PD). In this review, we will discuss the global scenario of research and therapeutic use of hESCs in the treatment of neurological disorders. Following this, we will discuss the development of a unique hESC line, how it differs from the other available hESC lines and its use in the treatment of neurological disorders. hESCs were isolated from mixture of neuronal and non-neuronal progenitor cells in their pre progenitor state in a Good Laboratory Practices, Good Tissue Practices and Good Manufacturing Practices compliant laboratory. Blastomere cells have served as a source to derive the hESCs and the xeno-free culture was demonstrated to be more safe and effective in clinical therapeutic application of hESCs. All the patients showed a remarkable improvement in their conditions and no serious adverse events were reported. This study concluded that hESC lines could be scalable and used in the treatment of various neurological disorders such as SCI, CP, and PD."
[Progress on bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells transplantation for spinal cord injury],"Wang L, Wang Q, Zhang XM.","AB  - Researchers are enthusiastically concerned about neural stem cell (NSC) therapy in a wide array of diseases, including stroke, neurodegenerative disease, spinal cord injury, and depression. Although enormous evidences have demonstrated that neurobehavioral improvement may benefit from NSC-supporting regeneration in animal models, approaches to endogenous and transplanted NSCs are blocked by hurdles of migration, proliferation, maturation, and integration of NSCs. Electrical stimulation (ES) may be a selective non-drug approach for mobilizing NSCs in the central nervous system. This technique is suitable for clinical application, because it is well established and its potential complications are manageable. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the emerging positive role of different electrical cues in regulating NSC biology in vitro and in vivo, as well as biomaterial-based and chemical stimulation of NSCs. In the future, ES combined with stem cell therapy or other cues probably becomes an approach for promoting brain repair."
A review of the emerging potential therapy for neurological disorders: human embryonic stem cell therapy,"Shroff G, Dhanda Titus J, Shroff R.","AB  - Regulation of hematopoietic stem cell release, migration, and homing from the bone marrow (BM) and of the mobilization pathway involves a complex interaction among adhesion molecules, cytokines, proteolytic enzymes, stromal cells, and hematopoietic cells. The identification of new mechanisms that regulate the trafficking of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) cells has important implications, not only for hematopoietic transplantation but also for cell therapies in regenerative medicine for patients with acute myocardial infarction, spinal cord injury, and stroke, among others. This paper reviews the regulation mechanisms underlying the homing and mobilization of BM hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, investigating the following issues: (a) the role of different factors, such as stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), among other ligands; (b) the stem cell count in peripheral blood and BM and influential factors; (c) the therapeutic utilization of this phenomenon in lesions in different tissues, examining the agents involved in HSPCs mobilization, such as the different forms of G-CSF, plerixafor, and natalizumab; and (d) the effects of this mobilization on BM-derived stem/progenitor cells in clinical trials of patients with different diseases."
Cord blood stem cells: a review of potential neurological applications,Harris DT.,"AB  - BACKGROUND: To compare the efficacy of the therapy of spinal cord injury with intravenous transplantation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) by Meta-analysis. METHODS: Studies of the BBB scores after intravenous transplantation of BMSCs were searched out from Pubmed, SCI, Cochrane Library, Chinese journal full-text database, China Biology Medicinedisc and Wanfang data-base and analyzed by Review Manager 5.2.5. RESULTS: Nine randomized controlled animal trials were selected with 235 rats enrolled. The studies are divided to different subgroups by different models of SCI and different time to transplantation. The results of Meta-analysis in different subgroups both indicated that the rats of experimental group (BMSCs group) got better BBB scores than control group at 1, 3 and over 5 weeks after intravenous transplantation of BMSCs with significant differences. The heterogeneity between impacted injury model and oppressed injury model subgroups decreased with the passage of time (I(2) = 75.8%, 39.7%, 0%). No heterogeneity was found between 3 d and 7 d subgroups. CONCLUSION: The intravenous transplantation of BMSCs is an efficient way to cure spinal cord injury, which can improve the motor function of rats. The therapeutic window is wide."
Clinical translation of human neural stem cells,"Tsukamoto A, Uchida N, Capela A, Gorba T, Huhn S.","AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells resident in adult bone marrow are best characterized by their capacity to differentiate into connective tissue cell types such as adipocytes, chondrocytes, osteoblasts and hematopoiesis-supporting stroma. Accordingly, these cells are being evaluated in human clinical trials for efficacy in treating genetic diseases of bone, to speed hematopoietic recovery after bone marrow transplantation and reduce the severity of graft versus host disease. In the past few years MSCs have also been reported to exhibit a broad degree of plasticity commensurate with other adult stem cell populations, including the ability to differentiate in vitro and in vivo into non-mesodermal cell types such as neurons and astrocytes. MSCs have also been reported to promote repair and regeneration of nervous tissue within the central and peripheral nervous system, although the mechanism by which this occurs remains indeterminate. Herein, we review evidence purporting the differentiation of MSCs into neural cell lineages and evaluate the utility of MSCs as cellular vectors for treating neurological disorders and spinal cord injury. Based on our analysis of their transcriptome, we also theorize how the varied functions of MSCs and their progeny in bone marrow may extrapolate to a therapeutic benefit in models of neurological disease."
Review of Caplan (1991) on cell-based therapeutic technology using Mesenchymal Stem Cells,"Wakitani S, Mera H, Nakamura N, Gobbi A.","AB  - It is estimated that as many as 128M individuals in the United States, or 1 in 3 people, might benefit from regenerative medicine therapy. Many of these usages include applications that affect the nervous system, including cerebral palsy, stroke, spinal cord injury and neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson's. The numbers of such individuals affected range from 10,000 (for cerebral palsy) to 700,000 annually (for stroke) at a cost of more than $65B. For the foreseeable future, regenerative medicine entrée to the clinic will depend upon the development of adult or non-embryonic stem (ES) cell therapies. Currently, non-ES cells easily available in large numbers from affected individuals can be found in the bone marrow, adipose tissue and umbilical cord blood (CB). It is our belief that CB stem cells are the best alternative to ES cells as these stem cells can be used to derive tissues from the mesodermal, endodermal and ectodermal germ lineages. CB contains a mixture of different types of stem cells in numbers not seen in any other location including embryonic-like stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, endothelial stem cells, epithelial stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells and unrestricted somatic stem cells. This review will summarize the findings reported in the literature with regards to the use of CB stem cells to neurological applications including in vitro work, pre-clinical animal studies, and patient clinical trials."
Plasticity and therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cells in the nervous system,"Phinney DG, Isakova I.","AB  - Human neural stem cell transplants have potential as therapeutic candidates to treat a vast number of disorders of the central nervous system (CNS). StemCells, Inc. has purified human neural stem cells and developed culture conditions for expansion and banking that preserve their unique biological properties. The biological activity of these human central nervous system stem cells (HuCNS-SC®) has been analyzed extensively in vitro and in vivo. When formulated for transplantation, the expanded and cryopreserved banked cells maintain their stem cell phenotype, self-renew and generate mature oligodendrocytes, neurons and astrocytes, cells normally found in the CNS. In this overview, the rationale and supporting data for pursuing neuroprotective strategies and clinical translation in the three components of the CNS (brain, spinal cord and eye) are described. A phase I trial for a rare myelin disorder and phase I/II trial for spinal cord injury are providing intriguing data relevant to the biological properties of neural stem cells, and the early clinical outcomes compel further development."
Therapeutic role of PTEN in tissue regeneration for management of neurological disorders: stem cell behaviors to an in-depth review,"Li Y, Ma R, Hao X.","AB  - Neural stem cells, which exist in various regions of the CNS throughout the mammalian lifespan, can be expanded and induced to differentiate into neurons and glia in vitro and in vivo. Because of these characteristics, there has been increasing interest in the identification and characterization of neural stem cells and neural progenitor cells both for basic developmental biology studies and for therapeutic applications to the damaged brain. Transplantation of neural stem cells or their derivatives into a host brain and the proliferation and differentiation of endogenous stem cells by pharmacological manipulations are potential treatments for many neurodegenerative diseases and brain injuries, such as Parkinson's disease, brain ischemia and spinal cord injury. Continued progress in neural stem cell research is providing a new future for brain repair."
Biology and clinical application of neural stem cells,Shimazaki T.,"AB  - Central nervous system (CNS) restoration is an important clinical challenge and stem cell transplantation has been considered a promising therapeutic option for many neurological diseases.

Use of human neural tissue for the generation of progenitors,"Greenfield JP, Ayuso-Sacido A, Schwartz TH, Pannullo S, Souweidane M, Stieg PE, Boockvar JA.","AB  - Bone marrow mesenchymal cells (BMSCs) are regarded as donor cells in cell transplantation therapies for spinal cord injury (SCI) for they have the ability of favourable proliferation and multi-directional differentiation, and are easily isolated and culturd and have less immunological reaction. It has been confirmed that subarachnoid space injection is the most ideal delivery technique of BMSCs. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells transplantation is safe and its reconditioning role is certain for SCI in early clinical application. The mechanism of BMSCs promoting functional recovery after SCI is probably concerned with vicarious function, nerve trophism, immunosuppression and promoting axonal regeneration by BMSCs."
The Current Update of Conventional and Innovative Treatment Strategies for Central Nervous System Injury,"Tsai MH, Wu CY, Wu CH, Chen CY.","AB  - Accumulating evidence suggests that a better understanding of normal human brain stem cells and tumor stem cells (TSCs) will have profound implications for treating central nervous system disease during the next decade. Neurosurgeons routinely resect excess surgical tissue containing either normal brain stem cells or TSCs. These cells are immediately available for expansion and use in basic biological assays, animal implantation, and comparative analysis studies. Although normal stem cells have much slower kinetics of expansion than TSCs, they are easily expandable and can be frozen for future use in stem cell banks. This nearly limitless resource holds promise for understanding the basic biology of normal brain stem cells and TSCs, which will likely direct the next major shift in therapeutics for brain tumors, brain and spinal cord injury, and neurodegenerative disease. This report reviews the progress that has been made in harvesting and expanding both normal and tumor-derived stem cells and emphasizes the integral role neurosurgeons will play in moving the neural stem cell field forward."
Modeling to optimize terminal stem cell differentiation,Gallicano GI.,"AB  - Neurological diseases and injuries in veterinary patients (horses, dogs, and cats) are complex, and effective treatment options are limited. Neuronal loss, damage to nerve conduction pathways, and inflammation and scarring associated with spinal cord injury pose major challenges in managing many neurological diseases. Furthermore, most of these neuropathologies lack definitive pharmacological treatments, driving interest and research into novel interventions. Our objective is to provide a narrative review of the current literature surrounding cellular therapies including neuronal and glial stem cells, neurotrophic factors, mesenchymal stem or stromal cells, and cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells for the treatment of diverse neurological pathologies. Cellular therapies have the potential for cellular replacement, immune modulation, and paracrine signaling and the flexibility of being used alone or alongside surgical intervention. Mesenchymal stem or stromal cells are arguably the most researched cellular therapy and have been administered intrathecally, IV, intra-arterially, intranasally, and intraspinally with few adverse reactions. Limited clinical and experimental studies have suggested efficacy in diseases including acute spinal cord injury and intervertebral disc disease. Little is currently known about the safety and efficacy of neural stem cells, precursor cell administration, and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived treatments. Further research is necessary to determine the efficacy and long-term safety of cellular therapies. Future aims should include larger controlled clinical trials in companion animals for common neurologic conditions including acute spinal cord injury, intervertebral disc disease, peripheral nerve injury, degenerative neuropathies, and age-associated cognitive decline."
Patient-Specific Age: The Other Side of the Coin in Advanced Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy,"Schimke MM, Marozin S, Lepperdinger G.","AB  - It has long been believed that the adult mammalian central nervous system does not regenerate after injury. However, recent advances in the field of stem cell biology, including the identification of Musashi-1-positive neural stem cells (NSCs) or NSC-like cells, has provided new insight for the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at inducing regeneration in the damaged central nervous system (CNS). The major strategies for inducing regeneration in the damaged CNS can be classified into two subgroups: (1) activation of endogenous neural stem cells and (2) cell transplantation therapies. In this paper, we would like to summarize our recent findings on the functions of the neural RNA-binding protein Musashi-l expressed in neural stem cells in relation to insult-induced neurogenesis, and therapeutic interventions for spinal cord injury, especially focusing on the treatment of spinal cord injury in the acute phase with anti-IL-6 receptor blocking antibody."
Adult neural stem cells and central nervous system repair,Okano H.,"AB  - Recovery from central nervous system damage in adult mammals is hindered by their limited ability to replace lost cells and damaged myelin, and reestablish functional neural connections. However, recent progresses in stem cell biology are making it feasible to induce the regeneration of injured axons after spinal cord injury. Transplantation of in vitro expanded neural stem cells into rat spinal cord 9 days after contusion injury induced their differentiation into neurons and oligodendrocytes, and the functional recovery of skilled forelimb movement. It was partly because the microenvironment within the injured spinal cord at 9 days after injury was more favorable for grafted neural stem cells in terms of their survival and differentiation."
[Advances in repair of spinal cord injury by transplantation of marrow mesenchymal stem cells],"Chen S, Lin J.","AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the advances in repair of spinal cord injury by transplantation of marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). METHODS: The related articles in recent years were extensively reviewed, the biological characteristic of MSCs,the experimental and clinical studies on repair of spinal cord injury by transplantation of MSCs, the machanisms of immigration and therapy and the problems were discussed and analysed. RESULTS: The experimental and clinical studies demonstrated that the great advances was made in repair of spinal cord injury by transplantation of MSCs. After transplantation, MSCs could immigrate to the position of spinal cord injury, and differentiate into nerve-like cells and secrete neurotrophic factors. So it could promote repair of injuryed spinal cord and recovery of neurological function. CONCLUSION: Transplantation of MSCs was one of effective ways in repair of spinal cord injury, but many problems remain to be resolved."
Making human neurons from stem cells after spinal cord injury,"Lowry NA, Temple S.",AB  - A new study by Yan and colleagues makes an important contribution to research on human spinal cord stem cells.
[Transplantation of neural stem cells into spinal cord after injury],"Nakamura M, Toyama Y.","AB  - Multipotential mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are present as a rare subpopulation within any type of stroma in the body of higher animals. Prominently, MSC have been recognized to reside in perivascular locations, supposedly maintaining blood vessel integrity. During tissue damage and injury, MSC/pericytes become activated, evade from their perivascular niche and are thus assumed to support wound healing and tissue regeneration. In vitro MSC exhibit demonstrated capabilities to differentiate into a wide variety of tissue cell types. Hence, many MSC-based therapeutic approaches have been performed to address bone, cartilage, or heart regeneration. Furthermore, prominent studies showed efficacy of ex vivo expanded MSC to countervail graft-vs.-host-disease. Therefore, additional fields of application are presently conceived, in which MSC-based therapies potentially unfold beneficial effects, such as amelioration of non-healing conditions after tendon or spinal cord injury, as well as neuropathies. Working along these lines, MSC-based scientific research has been forged ahead to prominently occupy the clinical stage. Aging is to a great deal stochastic by nature bringing forth changes in an individual fashion. Yet, is aging of stem cells or/and their corresponding niche considered a determining factor for outcome and success of clinical therapies?"
Human nerual stem cells for brain repair,"Kim SU, Lee HJ, Park IH, Chu K, Lee ST, Kim M, Roh JK, Kim SK, Wang KC.","AB  - Embryonic stem cell (ESC), iPCs, and adult stem cells (ASCs) all are among the most promising potential treatments for heart failure, spinal cord injury, neurodegenerative diseases, and diabetes. However, considerable uncertainty in the production of ESC-derived terminally differentiated cell types has limited the efficiency of their development. To address this uncertainty, we and other investigators have begun to employ a comprehensive statistical model of ESC differentiation for determining the role of intracellular pathways (e.g., STAT3) in ESC differentiation and determination of germ layer fate. The approach discussed here applies the Baysian statistical model to cell/developmental biology combining traditional flow cytometry methodology and specific morphological observations with advanced statistical and probabilistic modeling and experimental design. The final result of this study is a unique tool and model that enhances the understanding of how and when specific cell fates are determined during differentiation. This model provides a guideline for increasing the production efficiency of therapeutically viable ESCs/iPSCs/ASC derived neurons or any other cell type and will eventually lead to advances in stem cell therapy."
Stem Cell Therapy for Neurogenic Bladder Dysfunction in Rodent Models: A Systematic Review,"Salehi-Pourmehr H, Hajebrahimi S, Rahbarghazi R, Pashazadeh F, Mahmoudi J, Maasoumi N, Sadigh-Eteghad S.","AB  - Cell replacement therapy and gene transfer to the diseased or injured brain have provided the basis for the development of potentially powerful new therapeutic strategies for a broad spectrum of human neurological diseases including Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke, spinal cord injury and brain cancer. In recent years, neurons and glial cells have successfully been generated from neural stem cells, and extensive efforts by investigators to develop neural stem cell-based transplantation therapies have been carried out. We review here notable experimental and pre-clinical studies we have previously conducted involving human neural stem cell-based cell- and gene-therapies for Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, ALS, stroke and brain cancer."
Crucial roles for olfactory ensheathing cells and olfactory mucosal cells in the repair of damaged neural tracts,"Ekberg JA, St John JA.","AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article reviews recent advances in the use of cell transplantation to promote recovery from traumatic injury of the CNS, focusing on axonal regeneration in the spinal cord. RECENT FINDINGS: The significant recent findings reported are: (1) the increased expression of inhibitory chondroitin sulphate-proteoglycans in host tissue following Schwann cell transplantation, highlighting the effects the transplant may have on the ability of the host tissue to support regeneration; (2) the ability of embryonic and neural stem cells to promote recovery following transplantation into experimental models of spinal cord injury; (3) that delayed grafting for several weeks after transplantation does not diminish the graft effectiveness and may be advantageous; (4) the use of transplanted fibroblasts engineered to express neurotrophic genes in a conditionally regulated manner using tetracycline-inducible promoters; and (5) the initial reports on phase 1 clinical trials of foetal spinal cord grafts into patients with post-traumatic syringomyelia demonstrating their feasibility and safety. SUMMARY: Recent advances largely involve experimental refinements of existing approaches and the emergent application of stem cell biology to overcome spinal cord injury. While most experimental studies concentrate on single or restricted combinations of approaches, the most effective clinical strategies will be multi-component. Their formulation will require the development of intermediate models for bridging the differences between experimental models in laboratory animals and naturally occurring traumatic injury in humans."
Transplant mediated repair of the central nervous system: an imminent solution?,"Lakatos A, Franklin RJ.","AB  - Olfactory ensheathing cells, the glial cells of the olfactory nervous system, exhibit unique growth-promoting and migratory properties that make them interesting candidates for cell therapies targeting neuronal injuries such as spinal cord injury. Transplantation of olfactory cells is feasible and safe in humans; however, functional outcomes are highly variable with some studies showing dramatic improvements and some no improvements at all. We propose that the reason for this is that the identity and purity of the cells is different in each individual study. We have shown that olfactory ensheathing cells are not a uniform cell population and that individual subpopulations of OECs are present in different regions of the olfactory nervous system, with strikingly different behaviors. Furthermore, the presence of fibroblasts and other cell types in the transplant can dramatically alter the behavior of the transplanted glial cells. Thus, a thorough characterization of the differences between olfactory ensheathing cell subpopulations and how the behavior of these cells is affected by the presence of other cell types is highly warranted."
Will improved understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in acute spinal cord injury improve the potential for therapeutic intervention?,"Dumont AS, Dumont RJ, Oskouian RJ.","AB  - PURPOSE: Neurogenic bladder dysfunction (NGB) has an impact on the quality of life, which made it an important research subject in preclinical studies. The present review investigates the effect of stem cell (SC) therapy on bladder functional recovery after the onset of spinal cord injury (SCI), multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson disease (PD), and stroke in rodent models. METHODS: All experiments evaluated the regenerative potential of SC on the management of NGB in rodent models up to June 2019, were included. From 1,189 relevant publications, 20 studies met our inclusion criteria of which 15 were conducted on SCI, 2 on PD, 2 on stroke, and 1 on MS in the rodent models. We conducted a meta-analysis on SCI experiments and for other neurological diseases, detailed urodynamic findings were reported. RESULTS: The common SC sources used for therapeutical purposes were neural progenitor cells, bone marrow mesenchymal SCs, human amniotic fluid SCs, and human umbilical cord blood SCs. There was a significant improvement of micturition pressure in both contusion and transaction SCI models 4 and 8 weeks post-SC transplantation. Residual urine volume, micturition volume, and bladder capacity were improved 28 days after SC transplantation only in the transaction model of SCI. Nonvoiding contraction recovered only in 56 days post-cell transplantation in the contusion model. CONCLUSION: Partial bladder recovery has been evident after SC therapy in SCI models. Due to limitations in the number of studies in other neurological diseases, additional studies are necessary to confirm the detailed mechanism for bladder recovery."
Paralysis recovery in humans and model systems,"Edgerton VR, Roy RR.","AB  - At the dawning of the present decade, deemed appropriately the Decade of the Spine, acute spinal cord injury lingers as a formidable disorder affecting society. The enormous physical, emotional and socioeconomic impact of acute spinal cord injury on society is well known. Consequently, intensive clinical and laboratory research efforts have focused on furthering contemporary understanding of the mechanisms involved in primary and secondary injury following spinal cord injury. Additionally, research has been devoted to investigations concerning the treatment of acute spinal cord injury using a myriad of strategies, some of which involve rational targeting of known pathophysiological mechanisms. A recent surge of studies endeavoring to dissect the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the development and perpetuation of acute spinal cord injury appear particularly promising as a basis for identifying candidate pathways of injury for therapeutic manipulation. Meritorious investigations examining changes in gene expression, especially pertaining to pathways of cell death and inflammation, are increasingly reported. Molecular therapies harnessing knowledge gleaned from the aforementioned groundwork, including stem cell transplantation, likely represent the future direction of treatment for acute spinal cord injury. The Decade of the Spine is poised to be a phase of advancement in the treatment of acute spinal cord injury and the importance of further elucidation of underlying pathophysiological mechanisms to targeted, rational therapy will likely become clearly evident."
"Where, oh where, have my stem cells gone?","Wexler E, Palmer T.","AB  - Considerable evidence now demonstrates that extensive functional and anatomical reorganization following spinal cord injury occurs in centers of the brain that have some input into spinal motor pools. This is very encouraging, given the accumulating evidence that new connections formed across spinal lesions may not be initially functionally useful. The second area of advancement in the field of paralysis recovery is in the development of effective interventions to counter axonal growth inhibition. A third area of significant progress is the development of robotic devices to quantify the performance level of motor tasks following spinal cord injury and to 'teach' the spinal cord to step and stand. Advances are being made with robotic devices for mice, rats and humans."
Neurogenesis: is the adult stem cell young or old?,"Ricard J, Liebl DJ.","AB  - During the summer of 2001, Americans were treated to high political drama courtesy of the debate over embryonic and adult stem cell research. The popular press was flush with predictions about how neural stem cells would reverse, almost by magic, the devastation caused by diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, stroke or spinal cord injury. Unfortunately, this promise remains unfulfilled because we have such a poor understanding of how stem cells function. With regard to adult stem cells, we are not even completely sure where they are, or how or when they got there. A provocative study by Ourednik et al. published in Science suggests that in primates, adult neural stem cells are allocated during early corticogenesis. The study also provides evidence for the existence of stem cells dispersed throughout the frontal cortex and striatum."
Critical issues of clinical human embryonic stem cell therapy for brain repair,"Li JY, Christophersen NS, Hall V, Soulet D, Brundin P.","AB  - Stem cell biology is one of the most exciting, controversial, and debated fields in science today. It has been suggested that neuronal replacement therapy using stem cell transplants may be one possible answer to a host of neuropathological disorders including spinal cord injury, stroke, and neurodegenerative diseases. Important sources for stem cells include the developing embryo and adult central nervous system, but will these populations of cells exhibit similar behavior and responses to stimuli? This review will discuss some important similarities and differences between the embryonic and adult stem cell, as well as the basis for developing therapeutic approaches for stem cell replacement."
Human stem cells for CNS repair,"Zietlow R, Lane EL, Dunnett SB, Rosser AE.","AB  - Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) provide hope as a potential regenerative therapy for neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease and spinal cord injury. Currently, ESC-based nervous system repair faces several problems. One major hurdle is related to problems in generating large and defined populations of the desired types of neurons from human ESCs (hESCs). Moreover, survival of grafted hESC-derived cells has varied and functional recovery in recipient animals has often been disappointing. Importantly, in clinical trials, adverse effects after surgery, including tumors or vigorous immune reactions, must be avoided. Here we highlight attempts to overcome these hurdles with hESCs intended for central nervous system repair. We focus on hESC-derived dopamine-producing neurons that can be grafted in Parkinson's disease and identify critical experiments that need to be conducted before clinical trials can occur."
Stem cells: a new paradigm in medical therapeutics,Mankikar SD.,"AB  - Although most peripheral tissues have at least a limited ability for self-repair, the central nervous system (CNS) has long been known to be relatively resistant to regeneration. Small numbers of stem cells have been found in the adult brain but do not appear to be able to affect any significant recovery following disease or insult. In the last few decades, the idea of being able to repair the brain by introducing new cells to repair damaged areas has become an accepted potential treatment for neurodegenerative diseases. This review focuses on the suitability of various human stem cell sources for such treatments of both slowly progressing conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and multiple sclerosis, and acute insult, such as stroke and spinal cord injury. Despite stem cell transplantation having now moved a step closer to the clinic with the first trials of autologous mesenchymal stem cells, the effects shown are moderate and are not yet at the stage of development that can fulfil the hopes that have been placed on stem cells as a means to replace degenerating cells in the CNS. Success will depend on careful investigation in experimental models to enable us to understand not just the practicalities of stem cell use, but also the underlying biological principles."
Remodelling the injured CNS through the establishment of atypical ectopic perivascular neural stem cell niches,"Pluchino S, Cusimano M, Bacigaluppi M, Martino G.","AB  - Even though the stem cells have been studied for decades, only during the past few years has there been an overwhelming proliferation of publications covering isolation, cultivation and utilization of the body's master cells. This paper attempts to summarize the recent studies in the field of stem cells. A number of studies have reported the existence of multipotent stem cells in the cord, cord blood, placenta, bone marrow, brain, heart, teeth, skin, liver, hair follicles and many other tissues and organs, giving rise to cell types other than their tissue of origin. Increased therapeutic use of stem cells has resulted in scientific methods of collection, testing, processing and storage of these cells, with minimal cell damage and differentiation. Cell expansion, bioreactors and tissue engineering are employed extensively to improve the cell dose and outcome. Stem cell infusion, transplantation and implantation are accepted curative therapies for many malignant and non-malignant conditions. Stem cell therapies also provide alternative solutions for the repair and regeneration of various tissues and organs. There has been a dramatic improvement in the understanding of immunosuppressive properties of stem cells on various immune cell types. Stem cells are found to secrete angiogenic cytokines that increase neovascularization. They bring the promise of curing a disease state as these cells normally regenerate tissues in a healthy organism. Stem cell transplantation, in isolation or in combination with other procedures, has been found to be effective. Stem cell therapy is also seen as a possible alternative for the treatment of different diseases such as juvenile diabetes, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cerebral palsy, stroke, spinal cord injury and Parkinson's disease. Regenerative medicine using human stem cells is one of the new and promising fields for treating various intractable diseases and damaged organs."
Advances toward regenerative medicine in the central nervous system: challenges in making stem cell therapy a viable clinical strategy,Stoll EA.,"AB  - This review describes shortly phenomena that take place in different parts of central nervous system (CNS) after the spinal cord injury: 1/ due to axotomy many of neurones present outside the cavity of lesion (even those of supraspinal origin) can atrophy or die as an effect of necrosis or apoptosis; 2/ at the injury site itself, the primary and secondary effects lead to increased cell loss and the scar or cyst formation that are the mechanical barrier for regenerating axons; 3/ due to abolished conduction across the injury site the spinal cord circuitry below the lesion is deprived of supraspinal inputs. Then this review presents the new therapeutic strategies that were developed recently to obtain at least partial recovery of motor functions after spinal cord injury. The cell body can be rescued by applying various factors that increase intrinsic neural repair (e.g. neurotrophins or anti-apoptotic agents). To enhance the axonal regrowth through the lesion cavity, the scar and cyst formation can be reduced by constructing the bridges using e.g. the Schwann cells, fetal tissue, stem cells, olfactory ensheating glial cells, or by application of macrophages. To induce partial restoration of some functions that are controlled by neural circuitry below the lesion the various methods for enhancing the plasticity in segmental circuitry were developed (e.g. rehabilitation by locomotor training or intraspinal transplantation of monoaminergic cells). As a consequence of the great unpredictability of effects obtained after injury at different parts of the spinal cord the various strategies for repair need to be coordinated for optimal recovery."
[Transplants as a therapy after spinal cord injury],Sławińska U.,"AB  - Compelling evidence exists that somatic neural stem/precursor cell (NPC)-based therapies protect the central nervous system (CNS) from chronic inflammation-driven degeneration, such as that occurring in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), multiple sclerosis (MS), cerebral ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke and spinal cord injury (SCI). However, while it was first assumed that NPC transplants may act through direct replacement of lost/damaged cells, it has now become clear that they are able to protect the damaged nervous system through a number of 'bystander' mechanisms other than the expected cell replacement. In immune-mediated experimental demyelination--both in rodents and non-human primates--others and we have shown that transplanted NPC possess a constitutive and inducible ability to mediate efficient 'bystander' myelin repair and axonal rescue. This novel mechanism(s), which may improve the success of transplantation procedures, is likely to be exerted by undifferentiated NPCs whose functional characteristics are regulated by both CNS-resident and blood-borne inflammatory cells releasing in situ major stem cell regulators. Here, we discuss some of these alternative 'bystander' mechanisms, while pointing at the formation of the atypical ectopic perivascular niches, as the most challenging example of reciprocal biologically sound cross talk between the inflamed microenvironment(s) and transplanted therapeutic NPCs."
Review of cellular therapies provides new insights into the potential treatment of diverse neurologic diseases in horses and dogs,"Colbath AC, Goodrich L, Frye C, Dow S.","AB  - Over recent years, there has been a great deal of interest in the prospects of stem cell-based therapies for the treatment of nervous system disorders. The eagerness of scientists, clinicians, and spin-out companies to develop new therapies led to premature clinical trials in human patients, and now the initial excitement has largely turned to skepticism. Rather than embracing a defeatist attitude or pressing blindly ahead, I argue it is time to evaluate the challenges encountered by regenerative medicine in the central nervous system and the progress that is being made to solve these problems. In the twenty years since the adult brain was discovered to have an endogenous regenerative capacity, much basic research has been done to elucidate mechanisms controlling proliferation and cellular identity; how stem cells may be directed into neuronal lineages; genetic, pharmacological, and behavioral interventions that modulate neurogenic activity; and the exact nature of limitations to regeneration in the adult, aged, diseased and injured CNS. These findings should prove valuable in designing realistic clinical strategies to improve the prospects of stem cell-based therapies. In this review, I discuss how basic research continues to play a critical role in identifying both barriers and potential routes to regenerative therapy in the CNS."
Restoring function to the injured human spinal cord,Borgens RB.,"AB  - Of catastrophic traumas to the human body, spinal cord injury (SCI) has least benefited innovations arising from the new biology. Since after WW II, the standard of care"" for SCI has changed little. The controversial use of high dosages of steroids has provided only modest benefit to patients--but not without the enhanced risk of mortality. Novel therapies arising from biochemistry and genetics have not materialized in over 15 years"
Genetically engineered human neural stem cells for brain repair in neurological diseases,Kim SU.,"AB  - Neural stem cells (NSCs)of the central nervous system (CNS) have recently received a great deal of attention and interest for their therapeutic potential for neurological disorders. NSCs are defined as CNS progenitor cells that have the capacity for self-renewal and multipotent potential to become neurons or glial cells. Recent studies have shown that NSCs isolated from mammalian CNS including human can be propagated in vitro and then implanted into the brain of animal models of human neurological disorders. Recently, we have generated clonally derived immortalized human NSC cell lines via a retroviral vector encoded with v-myc oncogene. One of the human NSC lines, HB1.F3, was utilized in stem-cell based therapy in animal models of human neurological disorders. When F3 human NSCs were implanted into the brain of murine models of lysosomal storage diseases, stroke, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease or stroke, implanted F3 NSCs were found to migrate to the lesion sites, differentiate into neurons and glial cells, and restore functional deficits found in these neurological disorders. In animal models of brain tumors, F3 NSCs could deliver a bioactive therapeutically relevant molecules to effect a significant anti-tumor response intracranial tumor mass. Since these genetically engineered human NSCs are immortalized and continuously multiplying, there would be limitless supply of human neurons for treatment for patients suffering from neurological disorders including stroke, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, ALS, multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury. The promising field of stem cell research as it applies to regenerative medicine is still in infancy, but its potential appears limitless, and we are blessed to be involved in this exciting realm of research."
Setting the stage for functional repair of spinal cord injuries: a cast of thousands,"Ramer LM, Ramer MS, Steeves JD.","AB  - Here we review mechanisms and molecules that necessitate protection and oppose axonal growth in the injured spinal cord, representing not only a cast of villains but also a company of therapeutic targets, many of which have yet to be fully exploited. We next discuss recent progress in the fields of bridging, overcoming conduction block and rehabilitation after spinal cord injury (SCI), where several treatments in each category have entered the spotlight, and some are being tested clinically. Finally, studies that combine treatments targeting different aspects of SCI are reviewed. Although experiments applying some treatments in combination have been completed, auditions for each part in the much-sought combination therapy are ongoing, and performers must demonstrate robust anatomical regeneration and/or significant return of function in animal models before being considered for a lead role."
Embryonic stem cells: from bench to bedside,"Pucéat M, Ballis A.","AB  - As early as their derivation, embryonic stem (ES) cells have attracted a great attention to clinicians. Derived from early embryos, these cells remain pluripotent in culture while they can be expanded in principle without limit. They give rise to most progenies and differentiate to all major somatic lineages of potential use in regenerative medicine. The great therapeutic promises put forward almost 10 years ago to cure or relieve degenerative diseases are still up to date. However, cell therapy is a complex process that significantly differs from drug-based medicine. Although a clinical trial has been announced by GERON for next year to cure spinal cord injury, many issues remain to be addressed at the bench before these cells can be used in clinics."
Stem cells in orthopedics: current concepts and possible future applications,"Bagaria V, Patil N, Sapre V, Chadda A, Singrakia M.","AB  - Stem cells are the cells that have the ability to divide for indefinite periods in culture and to give rise to specialized cells. Sources of these cells include embryo, umbilical cord and certain sites in adults such as the central nervous system [CNS] and bone marrow. Its use hold promise of wide spread applications particularly in areas of spinal cord injury, difficult non-unions, critical bone defects, spinal fusions, augmentation of ligament reconstructions, cartilage repair and degenerative disc disorders. This review article contains current information derived from Medline searches on the use in various orthopedic subspecialties. Some issues remain at the forefront of the controversy involving stem cell research - legislation, ethics and public opinion, cost and concentration methods. As is true with any new technology, the enthusiasm for this technology that has potential to influence virtually every orthopedic case management, must be balanced by subjecting it to stringent clinical and basic research investigations."
Stem cells: therapeutic present and future,Khurdayan VK.,"AB  - A great deal of interest has attracted the attention of researchers on the potential use of (neural) stem cells in cell replacement or restorative therapies for heretofore incurable CNS pathologies such as brain stroke, spinal cord injury, Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis. This short perspective illustrates our view of neural stem cell research with a focus on the stem cell concept, on the in situ identity of neural stem cells and on selected aspects of embryonic and adult neurogenesis. A brief survey of current stem cell-based experimental literature tries to provide a realistic picture of how far we have gone in the quest to establish a restorative neurology."
Neural stem cells and the quest for restorative neurology,"Luque JM, Giménez y Ribotta M.","AB  - Malignant tumors remain virtually untreatable and inevitably lethal despite extensive surgical excision and adjuvant radio- and chemotherapy. Therefore, the development of more effective tumor-selective therapies is necessary. Stem/progenitor cells that self-renew, differentiate and display inherent tumor-tropic properties can be exploited for targeted delivery of therapeutic genes to invasive and metastatic tumors. In this review, we mainly introduce the application in Glioma, Breast cancer, Spinal cord injury, AD and so on. The promising field of stem cell research as it applies to regenerative medicine is still in infancy, but its potential appears limitless, and we are blessed to be involved in this exciting realm of research."
Therapeutic gene products delivery by neuron stem cells,"Tan J, Meng Y, Huang S, Wang P.","AB  - Ever since the first embryonic stem cells were isolated in the 1990s scientists and clinicians as well as the general public have followed the development of the field with great attention. As unspecialized cells capable of dividing, renewing and differentiating into specialized cells, stem cells hold great promise as a therapeutic strategy for many diseases, especially those of degenerative nature. In 2006, stem cells were actively investigated in preclinical and clinical settings to manage heart failure, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal cord injury, stroke, hematologic disorders, renal cell carcinoma, solid tumor cancer, Crohn's disease and cirrhosis, among other disorders. Likewise, biotech and pharmaceutical industry highlighted stem cells and associated products and technologies as useful tools for drug discovery that provide relevant clinical models and ensure efficacious transition of investigational compounds into preclinical testing."
[Embryonic stem cell research],"Kadota S, Aiba K, Nakatsuji N.","AB  - Research using human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines has expanded dramatically because of two attractive capacity; self-renewal and differentiation into almost all cell types. For therapeutic purposes, many researchers are trying to establish methods for maintaining pluripotency in defined xeno-free conditions and scalable culture systems. Banking of hESC lines is important for the wide spread of personalized cell therapy and transplantation. We introduced the ongoing clinical trials using hESC-derived cells in patients with subacute spinal cord injury and Stargardt's macular dystrophy. We also discussed opportunities and an example for the use of hESC in drug discovery. Finally, we introduced transgenic hESC as a disease model."
Perinatal applications of neural stem cells,"Kennea NL, Mehmet H.","AB  - The brain, unlike many tissues, has a limited capacity for self-repair and so there has been great interest in the possibility of transplanting neural cells to replace those lost through injury or disease. Encouraging research in humans is already underway examining the possibility of neural cell replacement in adult neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington disease. In addition, experiments exploring neural stem cell replacement in rodent models of acute stroke, demyelination and spinal cord injury have demonstrated functional improvements in treated animals. When considering perinatal neural stem cell therapy, it should not be overlooked that the immature, developing brain might provide a more favourable environment for stem cell integration. However, considerable advances need to be made both in understanding the basic biology of neural stem cells, including the instructive signals that determine their proliferation and differentiation, and in characterising their responses when transplanted in a damaged or diseased area of the brain."
Adult human neural stem cells for cell-replacement therapies in the central nervous system,"Galvin KA, Jones DG.","AB  - Human neural stem cells (HNSCs) can be isolated from both the developing and adult central nervous system (CNS). HNSCs can be successfully grown in culture, are self-renewable, and can generate mature neuronal and glial progeny. Embryonic HNSCs can be induced to differentiate into specific neuronal phenotypes. HNSCs successfully integrate into the host environment after transplantation into the developing or adult CNS. HNSCs transplanted into animal models of Parkinson's disease and spinal cord injury have induced functional recovery. The risks associated with stem cell transplantation trials are difficult to assess, but have not become overtly apparent throughout preclinical investigations. Major hurdles remain to be overcome before human clinical trials can be embarked upon."
[Stem cells and neural repair],Privat A.,"AB  - The presence of stem cells in the central nervous system of adult rodents has been suspected some forty years ago. However, it is only since two decades that the ability of those cells to give rise to neurons has been demonstrated in two regions of the CNS, the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the olfactory bulb. It is only recently that stem cells have been identified in the hippocampus of adult Humans. Stem cells have been transplanted in animal models of Nervous pathologies, to compensate for a deficit in neurotransmitters (Parkinson's disease) or of trophic factors (Spinal cord injury) with encouraging but not decisive results. Future progresses are expected from the us of intrinsic stem cells whose fate could be controlled thanks to the modern tools of gene therapy."
Human Pluripotent Stem Cells-Based Therapies for Neurodegenerative Diseases: Current Status and Challenges,"Ford E, Pearlman J, Ruan T, Manion J, Waller M, Neely GG, Caron L.","AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by irreversible cell damage, loss of neuronal cells and limited regeneration potential of the adult nervous system. Pluripotent stem cells are capable of differentiating into the multitude of cell types that compose the central and peripheral nervous systems and so have become the major focus of cell replacement therapies for the treatment of neurological disorders. Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) and human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cells have both been extensively studied as cell therapies in a wide range of neurodegenerative disease models in rodents and non-human primates, including Parkinson's disease, stroke, epilepsy, spinal cord injury, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis and pain. In this review, we discuss the latest progress made with stem cell therapies targeting these pathologies. We also evaluate the challenges in clinical application of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-based therapies including risk of oncogenesis and tumor formation, immune rejection and difficulty in regeneration of the heterogeneous cell types composing the central nervous system."
A Need for Renewed and Cohesive US Policy on Cord Blood Banking,"Matsumoto MM, Matthews KR.","AB  - Stem cells obtained from umbilical cord blood (CB) are used to treat more than 80 different diseases and are a standard treatment for many types of leukemias, lymphomas, myelodysplasias, and inherited immune system disorders. CB transplants have been carried out in humans for over 25 years, and hundreds of clinical trials are currently underway investigating CB's therapeutic potential for a wide range of disorders, including autism, diabetes, cerebral palsy, and spinal cord injury. Extensive storage facilities have been established in the United States and around the world to collect, test, and freeze CB for later use in medical procedures. However, a divide between two different banking models-public versus private-has emerged, presenting several policy challenges. While the Food and Drug Administration currently regulates CB storage and use in the United States, other state and federal guidelines on CB education, awareness, and ethical considerations remain variable, and no mandatory international guidelines exist. In addition, federal funding for an important CB collection initiative that specifically targets minority populations is set to expire by the end of FY2015. To help organize and coordinate efforts across the United States and other nations, policymakers should implement regulations for: high quality standards for both private and public CB banks, a commitment to ethical practices, and an investment in educational campaigns and training programs for all steps of the CB banking process."
Neural stem cell-based treatment for neurodegenerative diseases,"Kim SU, Lee HJ, Kim YB.","AB  - Human neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are caused by a loss of neurons and glia in the brain or spinal cord. Neurons and glial cells have successfully been generated from stem cells such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and neural stem cells (NSCs), and stem cell-based cell therapies for neurodegenerative diseases have been developed. A recent advance in generation of a new class of pluripotent stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), derived from patients' own skin fibroblasts, opens doors for a totally new field of personalized medicine. Transplantation of NSCs, neurons or glia generated from stem cells in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, including PD, HD, ALS and AD, demonstrates clinical improvement and also life extension of these animals. Additional therapeutic benefits in these animals can be provided by stem cell-mediated gene transfer of therapeutic genes such as neurotrophic factors and enzymes. Although further research is still needed, cell and gene therapy based on stem cells, particularly using neurons and glia derived from iPSCs, ESCs or NSCs, will become a routine treatment for patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases and also stroke and spinal cord injury."
Neural tissue engineering using embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells,Willerth SM.,"AB  - With the recent start of the first clinical trial evaluating a human embryonic stem cell-derived therapy for the treatment of acute spinal cord injury, it is important to review the current literature examining the use of embryonic stem cells for neural tissue engineering applications with a focus on diseases and disorders that affect the central nervous system. Embryonic stem cells exhibit pluripotency and thus can differentiate into any cell type found in the body, including those found in the nervous system. A range of studies have investigated how to direct the differentiation of embryonic cells into specific neural phenotypes using a variety of cues to achieve the goal of replacing diseased or damaged neural tissue. Additionally, the recent development of induced pluripotent stem cells provides an intriguing alternative to the use of human embryonic stem cell lines for these applications. This review will discuss relevant studies that have used embryonic stem cells to replicate the tissue found in the central nervous system as well as evaluate the potential of induced pluripotent stem cells for the aforementioned applications."
Present situation and future aspects of spinal cord regeneration,"Enomoto M, Wakabayashi Y, Qi ML, Shinomiya K.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) often represents a condition of permanent neurologic deficit. It has been possible to understand and delineate the mechanisms contributing to loss of function following primary injury. The clinicians might hope to improve the outcome in SCI injury by designing treatment strategies that could target these secondary mechanisms of response to injury. However, the approaches like molecular targeting of the neurons or surgical interventions have yielded very limited success till date. In recent times, a great thrust is put on to the cellular transplantation mode of treatment strategies to combat SCI problems so as to gain maximum functional recovery. In this review, we discuss about the various cellular transplantation strategies that could be employed in the treatment of SCI. The success of such cellular approaches involving Schwann cells, olfactory ensheathing cells, peripheral nerve, embryonic CNS tissue and activated macrophage has been supported by a number of reports and has been detailed here. Many of these cell transplantation strategies have reached the clinical trial stages. Also, the evolving field of stem cell therapy has made it possible to contemplate the role of both embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells to stimulate the differentiation of neurons when transplanted in SCI models. Moreover, the roles of tissue engineering techniques and synthetic biomaterials have also been explained with their beneficial and deleterious effects. Many of these cell-based therapeutic approaches have been able to cause only a little change in recovery and a combinatorial approach involving more than one strategy are now being tried out to successfully treat SCI and improve functional recovery."
Cellular transplantation-based evolving treatment options in spinal cord injury,"Wu MC, Yuan H, Li KJ, Qiu DL.","AB  - The central nervous system (CNS) has a limited capacity for regeneration after injury. In spinal cord injury (SCI) patients, total loss of all motor and sensory function occurs below the level of injury. Advances in treatment are expected for orthopedic and spinal surgeons. Recently, evidence of axonal regeneration and functional recovery has been reported in animal spinal cord injury models. Our studies on the roles of inhibitory molecules with a comparison between neonatal and adult animals may help serve as therapeutic targets to enhance axonal regeneration for the injured spinal cord. Also, our cell replacement study indicates the possibility of transplanting neural stem cells to supply the cell source for immature oligodendrocytes, which are thought to be essential for both the myelination and trophic support of regenerating axons in the spinal cord. Administration of neurotrophic factors, prevention of inhibitory factors, and stem cell technology have clinical applications in SCI patients. However, spinal cord regeneration involves a multistep process, and several factors have to be controlled after injury. A combination of several treatments could overcome a nonpermissive environment for spinal cord regeneration. Further understanding of the mechanisms and finding optimal targets of spinal cord regeneration are necessary to obtain successful therapies for SCI patients."
Stem Cells: A Review Encompassing the Literature with a Special Focus on the Side-Lined Miraculous Panacea; Pre-Morula Stem Cells,"Saini AK, Saini R, Bansode H, Singh A, Singh L.","AB  - Stem cells are the undifferentiated cells in the body that possess the ability to differentiate and give rise to any type of cells in the body. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in therapies involving stem cells as different treatment methods got developed. Depending on the source, there are two major kinds of stem cells, embryonic and adult stem cells. The former type is found in the embryo at the different developmental stages before the implantation and excels the latter owing to pluripotency. On the premise of the attributes of stem cells, they are touted as the panacea for all ills"" and are extensively sought for their potential therapeutic roles. There are a lot of robust pieces of evidence that have proved to cure the different ailments in the body like Huntington disease"
Review of the Current Knowledge on the Role of Stem Cell Transplantation in Neurorehabilitation,"Kamelska-Sadowska AM, Wojtkiewicz J, Kowalski IM.","AB  - The management involving stem cell (SC) therapy along with physiotherapy offers tremendous chance for patients after spinal cord injury (SCI), traumatic brain injury (TBI), stroke, etc. However, there are still only a limited number of reports assessing the impact of stem cells (SCs) on the rehabilitation process and/or the results of the simultaneous use of SC and rehabilitation. Additionally, since there is still not enough convincing evidence about the effect of SCT on humans, e.g., in stroke, there have been no studies conducted concerning rehabilitation program formation and expected outcomes. It has been shown that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BMSCs) transplantation in rats combined with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) can promote the functional recovery of hind limbs after SCI. An anti-inflammatory effect has been shown. One case study showed that, after the simultaneous use of SCT and rehabilitation, an SCI patient progressed from ASIA Grade A to ASIA Grade C. Such promising data in the case of complete tetraplegia could be a breakthrough in the treatment of neurologic disorders in humans. Although SCT appears as a promising method for the treatment of neurological conditions, e.g., complete tetraplegia, much work should be done towards the development of rehabilitation protocols."
Regeneration of the damaged central nervous system through reprogramming technology: basic concepts and potential application for cell replacement therapy,"Matsui T, Akamatsu W, Nakamura M, Okano H.","AB  - Neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation provides a new approach for the repair of damage to the central nervous system (CNS), including that resulting from cerebral infarction and spinal cord injury (SCI). In the past, there were no reputable means of converting non-neural somatic cells into neural cells. This status was overturned by the establishment of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, which have pluripotency akin to that of embryonic stem (ES) cells and can differentiate into most cells of the three germ layers. If differentiated somatic cells could be reprogrammed into iPS cells, and if these iPS cells could be induced to differentiate once again, it would be theoretically possible to obtain a large number of neural cells. However, this is not yet feasible due to the limitations of existing stem cell technology. Induction of neural cells from iPS cells is currently hindered by two distinct problems: 1) the preparation of specific types of targeted neural cells requires extensive cell culture, and 2) tumors are likely to form due to the presence of residual undifferentiated cells following transplantation of the induced cells. By contrast, direct induction methods permit the generation of target cells from somatic cells without the transitional iPS cell stage. This review outlines the present-day status of research surrounding the direct induction of NSCs from somatic cells, as well as the perspectives for the future clinical application of this technique for cell replacement therapy following CNS injury."
Bridging the gap: Spinal cord fusion as a treatment of chronic spinal cord injury,"Ren X, Kim CY, Canavero S.","AB  - Despite decades of animal experimentation, human translation with cell grafts, conduits, and other strategies has failed to cure patients with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). Recent data show that motor deficits due to spinal cord transection in animal models can be reversed by local application of fusogens, such as Polyethylene glycol (PEG). Results proved superior at short term over all other treatments deployed in animal studies, opening the way to human trials. In particular, removal of the injured spinal cord segment followed by PEG fusion of the two ends along with vertebral osteotomy to shorten the spine holds the promise for a cure in many cases."
Human dental mesenchymal stem cells and neural regeneration,"Xiao L, Tsutsui T.","AB  - Nerve tissue presents inherent difficulties for its effective regeneration. Stem cell transplantation is considered an auspicious treatment for neuronal injuries. Recently, human dental mesenchymal stem cells (DMSCs) have received extensive attention in the field of regenerative medicine due to their accessibility and multipotency. Since their origin is within the neural crest, they can be differentiated into neural crest-derived cells including neuron and glia cells both in vitro and in vivo. DMSCs are also able to secrete a wide variety of neurotrophins and chemokines, which promote neuronal cells to survival and differentiation. Experimental evidence has shown that human DMSCs engraftment recovered neuronal tissue damage in animal models of central nervous system injuries. Human DMSCs can be a new hope for treatment of nervous system diseases and deficits such as spinal cord injury, stroke and Parkinson's disease."
Concise review: animal substance-free human embryonic stem cells aiming at clinical applications,"Hovatta O, Rodin S, Antonsson L, Tryggvason K.","AB  - Human embryonic stem cells have been considered the gold standard as a cell source for regenerative medicine since they were first cultured in 1998. They are pluripotent and can form principally all the cells types in the body. They are obtained from supernumerary human in vitro fertilization embryos that cannot be used for infertility treatment. Following studies on factors regulating pluripotency and differentiation, we now have techniques to establish and effectively expand these cells in animal substance-free conditions, even from single cells biopsied from eight-cell stage embryos in chemically defined feeder-free cultures. The genetic stability and absence of tumorigenic mutations can be determined. There are satisfactory animal tests for functionality and safety. The first clinical trials are ongoing for two indications: age-related macular degeneration and spinal cord injury."
Neurotrauma and mesenchymal stem cells treatment: From experimental studies to clinical trials,"Martinez AM, Goulart CO, Ramalho Bdos S, Oliveira JT, Almeida FM.","AB  - Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy has attracted the attention of scientists and clinicians around the world. Basic and pre-clinical experimental studies have highlighted the positive effects of MSC treatment after spinal cord and peripheral nerve injury. These effects are believed to be due to their ability to differentiate into other cell lineages, modulate inflammatory and immunomodulatory responses, reduce cell apoptosis, secrete several neurotrophic factors and respond to tissue injury, among others. There are many pre-clinical studies on MSC treatment for spinal cord injury (SCI) and peripheral nerve injuries. However, the same is not true for clinical trials, particularly those concerned with nerve trauma, indicating the necessity of more well-constructed studies showing the benefits that cell therapy can provide for individuals suffering the consequences of nerve lesions. As for clinical trials for SCI treatment the results obtained so far are not as beneficial as those described in experimental studies. For these reasons basic and pre-clinical studies dealing with MSC therapy should emphasize the standardization of protocols that could be translated to the clinical set with consistent and positive outcomes. This review is based on pre-clinical studies and clinical trials available in the literature from 2010 until now. At the time of writing this article there were 43 and 36 pre-clinical and 19 and 1 clinical trials on injured spinal cord and peripheral nerves, respectively."
Regulation of axonal regeneration after mammalian spinal cord injury,"Zheng B, Tuszynski MH.","AB  - One hundred years ago, Ramón y Cajal, considered by many as the founder of modern neuroscience, stated that neurons of the adult central nervous system (CNS) are incapable of regenerating. Yet, recent years have seen a tremendous expansion of knowledge in the molecular control of axon regeneration after CNS injury. We now understand that regeneration in the adult CNS is limited by (1) a failure to form cellular or molecular substrates for axon attachment and elongation through the lesion site; (2) environmental factors, including inhibitors of axon growth associated with myelin and the extracellular matrix; (3) astrocyte responses, which can both limit and support axon growth; and (4) intraneuronal mechanisms controlling the establishment of an active cellular growth programme. We discuss these topics together with newly emerging hypotheses, including the surprising finding from transcriptomic analyses of the corticospinal system in mice that neurons revert to an embryonic state after spinal cord injury, which can be sustained to promote regeneration with neural stem cell transplantation. These gains in knowledge are steadily advancing efforts to develop effective treatment strategies for spinal cord injury in humans."
Clinical application of stem cell therapy in neurogenic bladder: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Salehi-Pourmehr H, Nouri O, Naseri A, Roshangar L, Rahbarghazi R, Sadigh-Eteghad S, Mahmoudi J, Mostafaei H, Roshandel MR, Hoseini L, Abolhasanpour N, Mostafaei A, Hajebrahimi S, Hashim H.","AB  - INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: This review aims to investigate the effect of stem cell (SC) therapy on the management of neurogenic bladder (NGB) in four neurological diseases, including spinal cord injury (SCI), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and stroke, in the clinical setting. METHODS: An electronic database search was conducted in the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Proquest, Clinicaltrial.gov , WHO, Google Scholar, MEDLINE via PubMed, Ovid, Web of Science, Scopus, ongoing trial registers, and conference proceedings in June 2019 and updated by hand searching on 1 February 2021. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi RCTs, phase I/II clinical trials, case-control, retrospective cohorts, and comprehensive case series that evaluated the regenerative potential of SCs on the management of NGB were included. Cochrane appraisal risk of bias checklist and the standardized critical appraisal instrument from the JBI Meta-Analysis of Statistics, Assessment, and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) were used to appraise the studies. RESULTS: Twenty-six studies among 1282 relevant publications met our inclusion criteria. Only SC therapy was applied for SCI or MS patients. Phase I/II clinical trials (without control arm) were the most conducted studies, and only four were RCTs. Four studies with 153 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The main route of transplantation was via lumbar puncture. There were no serious adverse events. Only nine studies in SCI and one in MS have used urodynamics, and the others have reported improvement based on patient satisfaction. SC therapy did not significantly improve residual urine volume, detrusor pressure, and maximum bladder capacity. Also, the quality of these publications was low or unclear. CONCLUSION: Although most clinical trials provide evidence of the safety and effectiveness of MSCs on the management of NGB, the meta-analysis results did not show a significant improvement; however, the interpretation of study results is difficult because of the lack of placebo controls."
An overview of tissue engineering approaches for management of spinal cord injuries,Samadikuchaksaraei A.,"AB  - Severe spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to devastating neurological deficits and disabilities, which necessitates spending a great deal of health budget for psychological and healthcare problems of these patients and their relatives. This justifies the cost of research into the new modalities for treatment of spinal cord injuries, even in developing countries. Apart from surgical management and nerve grafting, several other approaches have been adopted for management of this condition including pharmacologic and gene therapy, cell therapy, and use of different cell-free or cell-seeded bioscaffolds. In current paper, the recent developments for therapeutic delivery of stem and non-stem cells to the site of injury, and application of cell-free and cell-seeded natural and synthetic scaffolds have been reviewed."
[Regeneration of central nervous system: its concept and strategy],"Okano H, Yoshizaki T, Okada S.","AB  - It had been long believed that our adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) does not regenerate after damage due to injuries or degenerative diseases, as Santiago Ramóny Cajal had indicated long time ago. Today, however, CNS came to be recognized as an important target of so called regenerative medicine"". We have been proposing that regeneration of CNS does include the following three concepts: i) re-growth of the damaged neuronal axons"
Immunosuppression in stem cell clinical trials of neural and retinal cell types: A systematic review,"Gowrishankar S, Smith ME, Creber N, Muzaffar J, Borsetto D.","AB  - BACKGROUND: Pharmacologic immunosuppression regimes are commonly employed in stem cell clinical trials to mitigate host immune rejection and promote survival and viability of transplanted cells. Immunosuppression and cell survival has been extensively studied in retinal and spinal tissues. The applicability of stem cell therapy is rapidly expanding to other sensory organs such as the ear and hearing. As regenerative therapy is directed to new areas, a greater understanding of immunosuppression strategies and their efficacy is required to facilitate translation to organ-specific biologic microenvironments. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review appraises the current literature regarding immunosuppression strategies employed in stem cell trials of retinal and neural cells. METHODS: This systematic review was performed in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Inclusion criteria included studies presenting data on neural or retinal cells as part of an in-human clinical trial that detailed the immunosuppression regime used. Exclusion criteria included non-English language studies, animal studies, review articles, case reports, editorials, and letters. The databases Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to February 2024. Risk of bias was evaluated using the ROBINS-I tool. RESULTS: Eighteen articles fit the inclusion criteria. Nine articles concerned retinal cells, 5 concerned spinal cord injury, and 4 concerned amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A multi-drug and short-term immunosuppression regime were commonly employed in the identified studies. Detected immune responses in treated patients were rare. Common immunosuppression paradigms included tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and tapering doses of steroids. Local immunosuppression with steroids was employed in some studies concerning retinal diseases. DISCUSSION: A short-term course of systemic immunosuppression seemed efficacious for most included studies, with some showing grafted cells viable months to years after immunosuppression had stopped. Longer-term follow-up is required to see if this remains the case. Side effects related to immunosuppression were uncommon."

Cellular therapy for treatment of spinal cord injury in Zebrafish model,"Tayanloo-Beik A, Rabbani Z, Soveyzi F, Alavi-Moghadam S, Rezaei-Tavirani M, Goodarzi P, Arjmand B, Larijani B.","AB  - Spinal cord injury is a serious problem with a high rate of morbidity and mortality for all persons, especially young people (15-25 years old). Due to the large burden and the costs incurred on the government, finding the best therapeutic approach is necessary. In this respect, treatment strategies based on the disease mechanism can be effective. After the first trauma of spinal cord cascades, cellular events happen one after the other known as secondary trauma. The mechanism of secondary events of spinal cord injury could be helpful for target therapy as trying to stop the secondary trauma. Herein, some medical and surgical therapy has been introduced and cell therapy strategy was considered as a recent method. Actually, cell therapy is defined as the application of different cells including mesenchymal stem cells, embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, and some others to replace or reconstruct the damaged tissues and restore their functions. However, as a newly emerged therapeutic method, cell therapy should be used through various subclinical studies in animal models to assess the efficacy of the treatment under controlled conditions. In this review, the role of Zebrafish as a recommended model has been discussed and combinatory approach as the probably most useful treatment has been suggested."
Mesenchymal stem cells: therapeutic outlook for stroke,"Honmou O, Onodera R, Sasaki M, Waxman SG, Kocsis JD.","AB  - Neural progenitor cells (NPC) represent the stem-like niche of the central nervous system that maintains a regenerative potential also in the adult life. Despite NPC in the brain are well documented, the presence of NPC in the spinal cord has been controversial for a long time. This is due to a scarce activity of NPC within spinal cord, which also makes difficult their identification. The present review recapitulates the main experimental studies, which provided evidence for the occurrence of NPC within spinal cord, with a special emphasis on spinal cord injury and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. By using experimental models, here we analyse the site-specificity, the phenotype and the main triggers of spinal cord NPC. Moreover, data are reported on the effect of specific neurogenic stimuli on these spinal cord NPC in an effort to comprehend the endogenous neurogenic potential of this stem cell niche."
Are there endogenous stem cells in the spinal cord?,"Ferrucci M, Ryskalin L, Busceti CL, Gaglione A, Biagioni F, Fornai F.","AB  - Adult bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) display a spectrum of functional properties. Transplantation of these cells improves clinical outcome in models of cerebral ischemia and spinal cord injury via mechanisms that may include replacement of damaged cells, neuroprotective effects, induction of axonal sprouting, and neovascularization. Therapeutic effects have been reported in animal models of stroke after intravenous delivery of MSCs, including those derived from adult human bone marrow. Initial clinical studies on intravenously delivered MSCs have now been completed in human subjects with stroke. Here, we review the reparative and protective properties of transplanted MSCs in stroke models, describe initial human studies on intravenous MSC delivery in stroke, and provide a perspective on prospects for future progress with MSCs."
Biology and clinical applications of mesenchymal stem cells,Barry FP.,"AB  - Stem cell populations are found in most adult tissues and, in general, their differentiation potential may reflect the local cell population. Hematopoietic, epidermal, mesenchymal, neural and hepatic stem cells have been described. It may be that, in the adult, these cells are the reservoirs of reparative cells that are mobilized following injury and migrate to the wound site where, in cooperation with local cells, they participate in the repair response. Mesenchymal stem cells, isolated from the bone marrow, have the capacity to differentiate into cells of connective tissues. Some striking examples of the therapeutic use of MSCs have been reported recently in applications such as coronary artery disease, spinal cord injury, Parkinson's Disease, and liver regeneration. In orthopaedic medicine, MSC therapy has been applied in bone and cartilage repair and in the treatment of osteoarthritis. The question of the host response to implanted MSCs is critical as these cells are being evaluated in clinical applications. There are several aspects to the implanted cell-host interaction that need to be addressed as we attempt to understand the mechanisms underlying stem cell therapies. These are (1) the host immune response to implanted cells, (2) the homing mechanisms that guide delivered cells to a site of injury, and (3) differentiation of implanted cells under the influence of local signals."
Miracle cells for natural dentistry - A review,"Somani R, Jaidka S, Bajaj N, Arora S.","AB  - Stem cells are undifferentiated cells that can differentiate into specialized cells. Recently, enormous growth has been seen in the recognition of stem cell-based therapies, which have the potential to ameliorate the life of patients with conditions that span from Parkinson's disease to cardiac ischemia to bone or tooth loss. This research has produced new but unexplored possibilities in the regeneration of different organs and tissues. Presently, research is focused on the proficiency of stem cells and their utilization in dentistry, which is gaining interest. The tooth is nature's esteem"" for these precious stem cells and there are a number of these cells in permanent and primary teeth"
The promise of stem cell and regenerative therapies for multiple sclerosis,"Payne N, Siatskas C, Bernard CC.","AB  - The regenerative capacity of the adult central nervous system (CNS) is severely limited and although partial regeneration can be observed in the CNS of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, these attempts at repair have been universally unsuccessful in preventing the accumulation of irreversible neurological deficits. Novel therapies to treat MS must therefore take into account the need for both immunomodulation and neuroprotection and, as such, multifaceted treatment strategies are required. Two complimentary approaches that aim to regenerate an incapacitated CNS have recently emerged. Firstly, targeting degraded myelin growth inhibitory molecules released as a consequence of the inflammatory process provides a unique opportunity to manipulate the microenvironment of the degenerating CNS. Proof of concept studies have established that this therapeutic approach has tremendous potential in regenerating damaged axons as demonstrated in models of spinal cord injury (SCI) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for MS. In addition, stem cell based therapies offer a means of modulating inflammatory immune cells and promoting tissue repair as shown in a number of allogeneic transplant and autoimmune settings. This review attempts to summarise some of these approaches."
Strategies and prospects of effective neural circuits reconstruction after spinal cord injury,"Yang B, Zhang F, Cheng F, Ying L, Wang C, Shi K, Wang J, Xia K, Gong Z, Huang X, Yu C, Li F, Liang C, Chen Q.","AB  - Due to the disconnection of surviving neural elements after spinal cord injury (SCI), such patients had to suffer irreversible loss of motor or sensory function, and thereafter enormous economic and emotional burdens were brought to society and family. Despite many strategies being dealing with SCI, there is still no effective regenerative therapy. To date, significant progress has been made in studies of SCI repair strategies, including gene regulation of neural regeneration, cell or cell-derived exosomes and growth factors transplantation, repair of biomaterials, and neural signal stimulation. The pathophysiology of SCI is complex and multifaceted, and its mechanisms and processes are incompletely understood. Thus, combinatorial therapies have been demonstrated to be more effective, and lead to better neural circuits reconstruction and functional recovery. Combinations of biomaterials, stem cells, growth factors, drugs, and exosomes have been widely developed. However, simply achieving axon regeneration will not spontaneously lead to meaningful functional recovery. Therefore, the formation and remodeling of functional neural circuits also depend on rehabilitation exercises, such as exercise training, electrical stimulation (ES) and Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). In this review, we summarize the recent progress in biological and engineering strategies for reconstructing neural circuits and promoting functional recovery after SCI, and emphasize current challenges and future directions."
Don't fence me in: harnessing the beneficial roles of astrocytes for spinal cord repair,"White RE, Jakeman LB.","AB  - Astrocytes comprise a heterogeneous cell population that plays a complex role in repair after spinal cord injury. Reactive astrocytes are major contributors to the glial scar that is a physical and chemical barrier to axonal regeneration. Yet, consistent with a supportive role in development, astrocytes secrete neurotrophic factors and protect neurons and glia spared by the injury. In development and after injury, local cues are modulators of astrocyte phenotype and function. When multipotent cells are transplanted into the injured spinal cord, they differentiate into astrocytes and other glial cells as opposed to neurons, which is commonly viewed as a challenge to be overcome in developing stem cell technology. However, several examples show that astrocytes provide support and guidance for axonal growth and aid in improving functional recovery after spinal cord injury. Notably, transplantation of astrocytes of a developmentally immature phenotype promotes tissue sparing and axonal regeneration. Furthermore, interventions that enhance endogenous astrocyte migration or reinvasion of the injury site result in greater axonal growth. These studies demonstrate that astrocytes are dynamic, diverse cells that have the capacity to promote axon growth after injury. The ability of astrocytes to be supportive of recovery should be exploited in devising regenerative strategies."
Exosome-mediated repair of spinal cord injury: a promising therapeutic strategy,"Yu T, Yang LL, Zhou Y, Wu MF, Jiao JH.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a catastrophic injury to the central nervous system (CNS) that can lead to sensory and motor dysfunction, which seriously affects patients' quality of life and imposes a major economic burden on society. The pathological process of SCI is divided into primary and secondary injury, and secondary injury is a cascade of amplified responses triggered by the primary injury. Due to the complexity of the pathological mechanisms of SCI, there is no clear and effective treatment strategy in clinical practice. Exosomes, which are extracellular vesicles of endoplasmic origin with a diameter of 30-150 nm, play a critical role in intercellular communication and have become an ideal vehicle for drug delivery. A growing body of evidence suggests that exosomes have great potential for repairing SCI. In this review, we introduce exosome preparation, functions, and administration routes. In addition, we summarize the effect and mechanism by which various exosomes repair SCI and review the efficacy of exosomes in combination with other strategies to repair SCI. Finally, the challenges and prospects of the use of exosomes to repair SCI are described."
"The role of mesenchymal stromal cells in spinal cord injury, regenerative medicine and possible clinical applications","Forostyak S, Jendelova P, Sykova E.","AB  - Diseases of the central nervous system still remain among the most challenging pathologies known to mankind, having no or limited therapeutic possibilities and a very pessimistic prognosis. Advances in stem cell biology in the last decade have shown that stem cells might provide an inexhaustible source of neurons and glia as well as exerting a neuroprotective effect on the host tissue, thus opening new horizons for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Here, we discuss the progress made in the cell-based therapy of spinal cord injury. An emphasis has been placed on the application of adult mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). We then review the latest and most significant results from in vitro and in vivo research focusing on the regenerative/neuroprotective properties of MSCs. We also attempt to correlate the effect of MSCs with the pathological events that are taking place in the nervous tissue after SCI. Finally, we discuss the results from preclinical and clinical trials involving different routes of MSC application into patients with neurological disorders of the spinal cord."
Tumorigenicity as a clinical hurdle for pluripotent stem cell therapies,"Lee AS, Tang C, Rao MS, Weissman IL, Wu JC.","AB  - Human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are a leading candidate for cell-based therapies because of their capacity for unlimited self renewal and pluripotent differentiation. These advances have recently culminated in the first-in-human PSC clinical trials by Geron, Advanced Cell Technology and the Kobe Center for Developmental Biology for the treatment of spinal cord injury and macular degeneration. Despite their therapeutic promise, a crucial hurdle for the clinical implementation of human PSCs is their potential to form tumors in vivo. In this Perspective, we present an overview of the mechanisms underlying the tumorigenic risk of human PSC-based therapies and discuss current advances in addressing these challenges."
Axonal growth inhibitors and their receptors in spinal cord injury: from biology to clinical translation,"Chambel SS, Cruz CD.","AB  - Axonal growth inhibitors are released during traumatic injuries to the adult mammalian central nervous system, including after spinal cord injury. These molecules accumulate at the injury site and form a highly inhibitory environment for axonal regeneration. Among these inhibitory molecules, myelin-associated inhibitors, including neurite outgrowth inhibitor A, oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein, myelin-associated glycoprotein, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and repulsive guidance molecule A are of particular importance. Due to their inhibitory nature, they represent exciting molecular targets to study axonal inhibition and regeneration after central injuries. These molecules are mainly produced by neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes within the scar and in its immediate vicinity. They exert their effects by binding to specific receptors, localized in the membranes of neurons. Receptors for these inhibitory cues include Nogo receptor 1, leucine-rich repeat, and Ig domain containing 1 and p75 neurotrophin receptor/tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 19 (that form a receptor complex that binds all myelin-associated inhibitors), and also paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and repulsive guidance molecule A bind to Nogo receptor 1, Nogo receptor 3, receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase σ and leucocyte common antigen related phosphatase, and neogenin, respectively. Once activated, these receptors initiate downstream signaling pathways, the most common amongst them being the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway. These signaling cascades result in actin depolymerization, neurite outgrowth inhibition, and failure to regenerate after spinal cord injury. Currently, there are no approved pharmacological treatments to overcome spinal cord injuries other than physical rehabilitation and management of the array of symptoms brought on by spinal cord injuries. However, several novel therapies aiming to modulate these inhibitory proteins and/or their receptors are under investigation in ongoing clinical trials. Investigation has also been demonstrating that combinatorial therapies of growth inhibitors with other therapies, such as growth factors or stem-cell therapies, produce stronger results and their potential application in the clinics opens new venues in spinal cord injury treatment."
Is cell transplantation a reliable therapeutic strategy for spinal cord injury in clinical practice? A systematic review and meta-analysis from 22 clinical controlled trials,"Zhao H, Sun QL, Duan LJ, Yang YD, Gao YS, Zhao DY, Xiong Y, Wang HJ, Song JW, Yang KT, Wang XM, Yu X.","AB  - PURPOSE: It is an open question whether cell transplantation can provide safety and effective outcome to spinal cord injury (SCI) patient which has remained controversial for almost 40 years. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cell transplantation in SCI patients. METHOD: Studies of the cell transplantation for SCI were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, Medline, Cochrane Library and analyzed quantitative data by Review Manager 5.3. RESULTS: Twenty-one clinical controlled studies with 973 patients were included. The pooled results suggested that cell transplantation significantly improved ASIA score, ASIA motor score, ASIA sensory score, Barthel Index score, residual urine volume, rehabilitative time of automatic micturition. Furthermore, subgroup analysis indicated that the stem cells exhibited more potent than the non-stem cells in spinal cord repair. Cell transplantation at more than 14 days after injury showed more significant improvements than that within 14 days from injury. The dosage of cell transplantation between 1-5 × 10(7) and 10-20 × 10(7) was the potent quantity for the patient with SCI. Intrathecal injection and intravenous + intrathecal injection showed more superior to the other method. The top 5 adverse events were febrile reaction (11.5%), neurologic pain (11.3%), headache (2.6%), neurologic deterioration (2.4%), and rigidity or spasticity (1.6%). CONCLUSION: Cell transplantation appears to be a safe therapeutic strategy possessing substantial beneficial effects in the patients with SCI in clinic. Moreover, treating SCI with stem cell, the dosage of cells between 1-5 × 10(7) and 10-20 × 10(7), in intermediate or chronic phase, minimally invasive techniques, may bring more advantage to SCI patient.

Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Macrophage Choreography Supporting Spinal Cord Repair,"Maldonado-Lasunción I, Verhaagen J, Oudega M.","AB  - Spinal cord injury results in destructive events that lead to tissue loss and functional impairments. A hallmark of spinal cord injury is the robust and persistent presence of inflammatory macrophages. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to benefit repair of the damaged spinal cord often associated with improved functional recovery. Transplanted MSCs immediately encounter the abundance of inflammatory macrophages in the injury site. It is known that MSCs interact closely and reciprocally with macrophages during tissue healing. Here, we will review the roles of (transplanted) MSCs and macrophages in spinal cord injury and repair. Molecular interactions between MSCs and macrophages and the deficiencies in our knowledge about the underlying mechanisms will be reviewed. We will discuss possible ways to benefit from the MSC-macrophage choreography for developing repair strategies for the spinal cord."
Current Trend and Pro-survival Approaches for Augmenting Stem Cell Viability,"Shende P, Gandhewar N.","AB  - BACKGROUND: Stem cells are of two types: embryonic and adult stem cells and they act as a repair system by replenishing body tissue. Stem cells differentiate into different types of cells, such as neural, hematopoietic, adipose, etc. and are used for the treatment of various conditions like myocardial infarction, spinal cord injury, Parkinson's disease and diabetes. METHODS: This article focuses on recent research development that addresses the viability issues of stem cells. The efficiency of transplanted stem cells reduces due to conditions like hypoxia, inflammation, nutrient deprivation, immunogenicity, extracellular matrix loss on delivery and mechanical stress. RESULTS: To increase the viability of stem cells, techniques like scaffolds of stem cells with hydrogel or alginate, pre-conditioning, different routes of administration and encapsulation, are implemented. CONCLUSION: For the protection of stem cells against apoptosis, different pathways, namely Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase (PI3K/AKT), Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF1), Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPK) and Hippo, are discussed. DISCUSSION: Activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway decreases the concentration of apoptotic factors, while the HIF pathway protects stem cells against the micro-environment of tissue (hypoxia)."
The stem cells as a potential treatment for neurodegeneration,"Daniela F, Vescovi AL, Bottai D.","AB  - Cell degeneration and death, be it extensive and widespread, such as in metabolic disorders, or focal and selective as in Parkinson's disease (PD), is the underlying feature of many neurological diseases. Thus, the replacement of cells lost by injury or disease has become a central tenet in strategies aiming at the development of novel therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative disorders. In addition to the in vivo recruitment of endogenous cells, which is now emerging as a promising novel strategy, the transplantation of new, exogenously generated brain cells is probably the most extensively studied methodology for cell replacement in the central nervous system, with the initial experimental clinical studies in PD dating back to the early 1970s (Bjorklund, A. and Stenevi, U., 1984, Intracerebral neural implants: neuronal replacement and reconstruction of damaged circuitries. Annu Rev Neurosci 7, 279-308; Snyder, B. J. and Olanow, C. W., 2005, Stem cell treatment for Parkinson's disease: an update for 2005. Curr Opin Neurol 18, 376-85). The need to generate the cells to be transplanted in large quantities and in a reproducible, steady, and safe fashion has long represented one of the major issues in this field, regardless of whether one was trying to produce specific cell subtypes or uncommitted and highly plastic neural precursors, which would respond to local, instructive cues, upon transplantation into the damaged area. Neural stem cells (NSCs), with their capacity for long-term expansion in vitro and their extensive functional stability and plasticity, allow now for the establishment of cultures of mature neural cells as well as highly undifferentiated precursors and are emerging as one of the most amenable cell sources for neural transplantation (Gage, F. H., 2000, Mammalian neural stem cells. Science 287, 1433-8; McKay, R., 1997, Stem cells in the central nervous system. Science 276, 66-71). This chapter illustrates the basic aspect of the handling and preparation of NSCs for experimental transplantation in two animal models of neurodegenerative disorders, namely, postcontusion spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis."
A new combined therapeutic strategy of governor vessel electro-acupuncture and adult stem cell transplantation promotes the recovery of injured spinal cord,"Liu Z, Ding Y, Zeng YS.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a very severe traumatic disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Because of its high incidence rate in causing disabilities, it brings great burdens to patients and society. Both Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Western Medicine have been adopted to ameliorate SCI with promising outcomes. In TCM, the use of Governor Vessel electro-acupuncture has achieved remarkable results on the rehabilitation of patients with SCI. In the past decade, Governor Vessel electro-acupuncture has also been used in experimentally induced SCI and this has resulted in promising functional recovery. Both neural stem cells (NSCs) and bone marrow mesenchymal cells (MSCs) have been used extensively in recent years for improvement of functional recovery of CNS disorders. We have used a combined approach by integrating the basic and clinical research in SCI in recent years. In this connection, transplantation of NSCs or MSCs coupled with the Governor Vessel electro-acupuncture (GV-EA) has been adopted to improve the recovery of SCI. Our study suggests that GV-EA may activate the process of cell metabolism, and initiate synthesis and secretion of endogenous neurotrophic factors in the ambient tissues at the lesion site of spinal cord. It is proposed that the new combined strategy could promote a better structural and functional recovery of injured spinal cord."
[The application of stem cells for research and treatment of neurological disorders],"Sveinsson OA, Gudjonsson T, Petersen PH.","AB  - It has long been a common view that neurons in the human central nervous system were not capable of self renewal. But in the mid-1990s scientists discovered that certain areas of the human brain do have the ability generate new neurons, at least under certain circumstances. It was subsecuently confirmed that the human central nervous system contains stem cells similar to the cells which originally give rise to the central nervous sysem during fetal development. The possible use of stem cells in the treatment of various neurological disorders, holds great promise. However, much research needs to be carried out before stem cell therapy can be moved from the bench to the bedside. Now researchers are pursuing two fundamental strategies to exploit the possible application of stem cells. One is to cultivate stem cells in vitro and to design the right differentiation profile of cells suitable for implantation. The other strategy relies on studying endogenous signals that could stimulate the patient s own stem cells and repair mechanisms. Here we give an overview of neural stem cells and their possible future use in the treatment of neural diseases such as Parkinson s disease, motor neuron disease and spinal cord injury."
Neural stem cells-trends and advances,"English D, Sharma NK, Sharma K, Anand A.","AB  - For many years, accepted dogma held that brain is a static organ with no possibility of regeneration of cells in injured or diseased human brain. However, recent preclinical reports have shown regenerative potential of neural stem cells using various injury models. This has resulted in renewed hope for those suffering from spinal cord injury and neural damage. As the potential of stem cell therapy gained impact, these claims, in particular, led to widespread enthusiasm that acute and chronic injury of the nervous system would soon be a problem of the past. The devastation caused by injury or diseases of the brain and spinal cord led to wide premature acceptance that neural stem cells (NSCs)"" derived from embryonic"
Sonic Hedgehog signaling and potential therapeutic indications,"Bambakidis NC, Onwuzulike K.","AB  - Traumatic injury to the adult spinal cord results in a massive loss of cells and permanent functional deficits. However, recent studies demonstrate that there is a proliferative response of endogenous glial precursors and progenitors and perhaps also pluripotent neural stem cells. These cells may prove to be an important new therapeutic target to improve recovery after injury to the spinal cord and brain."
Stem cells in spinal cord injury,"Wrathall JR, Lytle JM.","AB  - Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a glycoprotein molecule that is expressed throughout the central nervous system (CNS). It is important during neurodevelopment, particularly through its induction of endogenous neural precursor cells and neural stem cells. The signaling system by which Shh has its diffuse effects on multiple end organs depends on a downstream signaling cascade initiated by binding to the receptor Patched (PTC) on Shh-specific target cells. The downstream signaling cascade has widespread effects on multiple organ systems. Research into tumor suppressive effects and germline mutations has uncovered important implications in neuro-oncology. Modulating the neuroproliferative effects of the Shh signaling cascade implicated a potential role in ameliorating the effects of CNS injury, particularly in animal models of spinal cord injury and cerebral cortical ischemia. This chapter provides a summary of the Shh signaling mechanism and a review of its impact in these neurological disorders."
Progress in the Use of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Neural Cells for Traumatic Spinal Cord Injuries in Animal Populations: Meta-Analysis and Review,"Ramotowski C, Qu X, Villa-Diaz LG.","AB  - Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are cells genetically reprogrammed from somatic cells, which can be differentiated into neurological lineages with the aim to replace or assist damaged neurons in the treatment of spinal cord injuries (SCIs) caused by physical trauma. Here, we review studies addressing the functional use of iPSC-derived neural cells in SCIs and perform a meta-analysis to determine if significant motor improvement is restored after treatment with iPSC-derived neural cells compared with treatments using embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived counterpart cells and control treatments. Overall, based on locomotion scales in rodents and monkeys, our meta-analysis indicates a therapeutic benefit for SCI treatment using neural cells derived from either iPSCs or ESCs, being this of importance due to existing ethical and immunological complications using ESCs. Results from these studies are evidence of the successes and limitations of iPSC-derived neural cells in the recovery of motor capacity. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2019;8:681&693."
Mesenchymal Stem Cells of Dental Origin-Their Potential for Antiinflammatory and Regenerative Actions in Brain and Gut Damage,"Földes A, Kádár K, Kerémi B, Zsembery Á, Gyires K, S Zádori Z, Varga G.","AB  - Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain and spinal cord injury and neuroinflammatory multiple sclerosis are diverse disorders of the central nervous system. However, they are all characterized by various levels of inappropriate inflammatory/immune response along with tissue destruction. In the gastrointestinal system, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is also a consequence of tissue destruction resulting from an uncontrolled inflammation. Interestingly, there are many similarities in the immunopathomechanisms of these CNS disorders and the various forms of IBD. Since it is very hard or impossible to cure them by conventional manner, novel therapeutic approaches such as the use of mesenchymal stem cells, are needed. Mesenchymal stem cells have already been isolated from various tissues including the dental pulp and periodontal ligament. Such cells possess transdifferentiating capabilities for different tissue specific cells to serve as new building blocks for regeneration. But more importantly, they are also potent immunomodulators inhibiting proinflammatory processes and stimulating anti-inflammatory mechanisms. The present review was prepared to compare the immunopathomechanisms of the above mentioned neurodegenerative, neurotraumatic and neuroinflammatory diseases with IBD. Additionally, we considered the potential use of mesenchymal stem cells, especially those from dental origin to treat such disorders. We conceive that such efforts will yield considerable advance in treatment options for central and peripheral disorders related to inflammatory degeneration."
"Stem cell therapies for neurological disorders: current progress, challenges, and future perspectives","Rahimi Darehbagh R, Seyedoshohadaei SA, Ramezani R, Rezaei N.","AB  - Stem cell-based therapies have emerged as a promising approach for treating various neurological disorders by harnessing the regenerative potential of stem cells to restore damaged neural tissue and circuitry. This comprehensive review provides an in-depth analysis of the current state of stem cell applications in primary neurological conditions, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke, spinal cord injury (SCI), and other related disorders. The review begins with a detailed introduction to stem cell biology, discussing the types, sources, and mechanisms of action of stem cells in neurological therapies. It then critically examines the preclinical evidence from animal models and early human trials investigating the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of different stem cell types, such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), neural stem cells (NSCs), and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). While ESCs have been studied extensively in preclinical models, clinical trials have primarily focused on adult stem cells such as MSCs and NSCs, as well as iPSCs and their derivatives. We critically assess the current state of research for each cell type, highlighting their potential applications and limitations in different neurological conditions. The review synthesizes key findings from recent, high-quality studies for each neurological condition, discussing cell manufacturing, delivery methods, and therapeutic outcomes. While the potential of stem cells to replace lost neurons and directly reconstruct neural circuits is highlighted, the review emphasizes the critical role of paracrine and immunomodulatory mechanisms in mediating the therapeutic effects of stem cells in most neurological disorders. The article also explores the challenges and limitations associated with translating stem cell therapies into clinical practice, including issues related to cell sourcing, scalability, safety, and regulatory considerations. Furthermore, it discusses future directions and opportunities for advancing stem cell-based treatments, such as gene editing, biomaterials, personalized iPSC-derived therapies, and novel delivery strategies. The review concludes by emphasizing the transformative potential of stem cell therapies in revolutionizing the treatment of neurological disorders while acknowledging the need for rigorous clinical trials, standardized protocols, and multidisciplinary collaboration to realize their full therapeutic promise."
Mesenchymal stromal cell therapies for traumatic neurological injuries,"Wang X, Wang Q, Xia Z, Yang Y, Dai X, Zhang C, Wang J, Xu Y.","AB  - Improved treatment options are urgently needed for neurological injuries resulting from trauma or iatrogenic events causing long-term disabilities that severely impact patients' quality of life. In vitro and animal studies have provided promising proof-of-concept examples of regenerative therapies using mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) for a wide range of pathological conditions. Over the previous decade, various MSC-based therapies have been investigated in clinical trials to treat traumatic neurological injuries. However, while the safety and feasibility of MSC treatments has been established, the patient outcomes in these studies have not demonstrated significant success in the translation of MSC regenerative therapy for the treatment of human brain and spinal cord injuries. Herein, we have reviewed the literature and ongoing registered trials on the application of MSC for the treatment of traumatic brain injury, traumatic spinal cord injury, and peripheral nerve injury. We have focused on the shortcomings and technological hurdles that must be overcome to further advance clinical research to phase 3 trials, and we discuss recent advancements that represent potential solutions to these obstacles to progress."
Human Endometrial Regenerative Cells for Neurological Disorders: Hype or Hope?,"Momeni J, Naserzadeh E, Sepehrinezhad A, Ashayeri Ahmadabad R, Sahab Negah S.","AB  - Despite enormous efforts, no effective medication has been found to significantly halt or even slow the progression of neurological diseases, such as acquired (e.g., traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, etc.) and chronic (e.g., Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, etc.) central nervous system disorders. So, researchers are looking for alternative therapeutic modalities to manage the disease's symptoms and stop it from worsening. Concerning disease-modifying capabilities, stem cell therapy has emerged as an expanding domain. Among different types of stem cells, human endometrial regenerative cells have excellent regenerative properties, making them suitable for regenerative medicine. They have the potential for self-renewal and differentiation into three types of stem cells: epithelial stem cells, endothelial side population stem cells, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). ERCs can be isolated from endometrial biopsy and menstrual blood samples. However, there is no comprehensive evidence on the effects of ERCs on neurological disorders. Hence, we initially explore the traits of these specific stem cells in this analysis, followed by an emphasis on their therapeutic potential in treating neurological disorders."
Repair of injured spinal cord using biomaterial scaffolds and stem cells,"Shrestha B, Coykendall K, Li Y, Moon A, Priyadarshani P, Yao L.","AB  - The loss of neurons and degeneration of axons after spinal cord injury result in the loss of sensory and motor functions. A bridging biomaterial construct that allows the axons to grow through has been investigated for the repair of injured spinal cord. Due to the hostility of the microenvironment in the lesion, multiple conditions need to be fulfilled to achieve improved functional recovery. A scaffold has been applied to bridge the gap of the lesion as contact guidance for axonal growth and to act as a vehicle to deliver stem cells in order to modify the microenvironment. Stem cells may improve functional recovery of the injured spinal cord by providing trophic support or directly replacing neurons and their support cells. Neural stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells have been seeded into biomaterial scaffolds and investigated for spinal cord regeneration. Both natural and synthetic biomaterials have increased stem cell survival in vivo by providing the cells with a controlled microenvironment in which cell growth and differentiation are facilitated. This optimal multi‒disciplinary approach of combining biomaterials, stem cells, and biomolecules offers a promising treatment for the injured spinal cord."
Adult stem cells and bioengineering strategies for the treatment of cerebral ischemic stroke,"Yu F, Morshead CM.","AB  - The adult central nervous system (CNS) contains a population of neural stem cells, yet unlike many other tissues, has a very limited capacity for self-repair. Promoting tissue repair and functional recovery following CNS injury or disease is a high priority as there are currently no effective treatments towards this end for the treatment of disorders such as stroke, traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury. Recent advances in stem cell biology have offered a number of enticing potential avenues and we will discuss these possibilities along with the associated challenges as they pertain to stroke. We will consider exogenous therapies involving the transplantation of adult stem cells, and the mobilization of endogenous stem cells, as well as drug delivery and tissue engineering strategies that enhance and complement the cell based strategies."
Survival and Integration of Transplanted Olfactory Ensheathing Cells are Crucial for Spinal Cord Injury Repair: Insights from the Last 10 Years of Animal Model Studies,"Reshamwala R, Shah M, St John J, Ekberg J.","AB  - Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), the glial cells of the primary olfactory nervous system, support the natural regeneration of the olfactory nerve that occurs throughout life. OECs thus exhibit unique properties supporting neuronal survival and growth. Transplantation of OECs is emerging as a promising treatment for spinal cord injury; however, outcomes in both animals and humans are variable and the method needs improvement and standardization. A major reason for the discrepancy in functional outcomes is the variability in survival and integration of the transplanted cells, key factors for successful spinal cord regeneration. Here, we review the outcomes of OEC transplantation in rodent models over the last 10 years, with a focus on survival and integration of the transplanted cells. We identify the key factors influencing OEC survival: injury type, source of transplanted cells, co-transplantation with other cell types, number and concentration of cells, method of delivery, and time of transplantation after the injury. We found that two key issues are hampering optimization and standardization of OEC transplantation: lack of (1) reliable methods for identifying transplanted cells, and (2) three-dimensional systems for OEC delivery. To develop OEC transplantation as a successful and standardized therapy for spinal cord injury, we must address these issues and increase our understanding of the complex parameters influencing OEC survival."
Optimising plasticity: environmental and training associated factors in transplant-mediated brain repair,"Döbrössy MD, Dunnett SB.","AB  - With progressively ageing populations, degeneration of nerve cells of the brain, due to accident or disease, represents one of the major problems for health and welfare in the developed world. The molecular environment in the adult brain promotes stability limiting its ability to regenerate or to repair itself following injury. Cell transplantation aims to repair the nervous system by introducing new cells that can replace the function of the compromised or lost cells. Alternatives to primary embryonic tissue are actively being sought but this is at present the only source that has been shown reliably to survive grafting into the adult brain and spinal cord, connect with the host nervous system, and influence behaviour. Based on animal studies, several clinical trials have now shown that embryonic tissue grafts can partially alleviate symptoms in Parkinson's disease, and related strategies are under evaluation for Huntington's disease, spinal cord injury, stroke and other CNS disorders. The adult brain is at its most plastic in the period following injury, offering a window of opportunity for therapeutic intervention. Enriched environment, behavioural experience and grafting can each separately influence neuronal plasticity and recovery of function after brain damage, but the extent to which these factors interact is at present unknown. To improve the outcome following brain damage, transplantation must make use of the endogenous potential for plasticity of both the host and the graft and optimise the external circumstances associated with graft-mediated recovery. Our understanding of mechanisms of brain plasticity subsequent to brain damage needs to be associated with what we know about enhancing intrinsic recovery processes in order to improve neurobiological and surgical strategies for repair at the clinical level. With the proof of principle beginning to emerge from clinical trials, a rich area for innovative research with profound therapeutic application, even broader than the specific context of transplantation, is now opening for investigation."
Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Induced Neuroprotection in Pediatric Neurological Diseases: Recent Update of Underlying Mechanisms and Clinical Utility,"Chen W, Ren Q, Zhou J, Liu W.","AB  - Pediatric neurological diseases refer to a group of disorders that affect the nervous system in children. These conditions can have a significant impact on a child's development, cognitive function, motor skills, and overall quality of life. Stem cell therapy is a new and innovative approach to treat various neurological conditions by repairing damaged neurons and replacing those that have been lost. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have gained significant recognition in this regard due to their ability to differentiate into different cell types. MSCs are multipotent self-replicating stem cells known to render promising results in the treatment of stroke and spinal cord injury in adults. When delivered to the foci of damage in the central nervous system, stem cells begin to differentiate into neural cells under the stimulation of paracrine factors and secrete various neurotrophic factors (NTFs) like nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) that expedite the repair process in injured neurons. In the present review, we will focus on the therapeutic benefits of the MSC-based therapies in salient pediatric neurological disorders including cerebral palsy, stroke, and autism."
Reprogramming of astrocytes to neuronal-like cells in spinal cord injury: a systematic review,"Alizadeh SD, Jalalifar MR, Ghodsi Z, Sadeghi-Naini M, Malekzadeh H, Rahimi G, Mojtabavi K, Shool S, Eskandari Z, Masoomi R, Kiani S, Harrop J, Rahimi-Movaghar V.","AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A Systematic Review OBJECTIVES: To determine the therapeutic efficacy of in vivo reprogramming of astrocytes into neuronal-like cells in animal models of spinal cord injury (SCI). METHODS: PRISMA 2020 guidelines were utilized, and search engines Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase until June 2023 were used. Studies that examined the effects of converting astrocytes into neuron-like cells with any vector in all animal models were included, while conversion from other cells except for spinal astrocytes, chemical mechanisms to provide SCI models, brain injury population, and conversion without in-vivo experience were excluded. The risk of bias was calculated independently. RESULTS: 5302 manuscripts were initially identified and after eligibility assessment, 43 studies were included for full-text analysis. After final analysis, 13 manuscripts were included. All were graded as high-quality assessments. The transduction factors Sox2, Oct4, Klf4, fibroblast growth factor 4 (Fgf4) antibody, neurogenic differentiation 1 (Neurod1), zinc finger protein 521 (Zfp521), ginsenoside Rg1, and small molecules (LDN193189, CHIR99021, and DAPT) could effectively reprogramme astrocytes into neuron-like cells. The process was enhanced by p21-p53, or Notch signaling knockout, valproic acid, or chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan inhibitors. The type of mature neurons was both excitatory and inhibitory. CONCLUSION: Astrocyte reprogramming to neuronal-like cells in an animal model after SCI appears promising. The molecular and functional improvements after astrocyte reprogramming were demonstrated in vivo, and further investigation is required in this field."
Advances in the research of the role of macrophage/microglia polarization-mediated inflammatory response in spinal cord injury,"Fu SP, Chen SY, Pang QM, Zhang M, Wu XC, Wan X, Wan WH, Ao J, Zhang T.","AB  - It is often difficult to regain neurological function following spinal cord injury (SCI). Neuroinflammation is thought to be responsible for this failure. Regulating the inflammatory response post-SCI may contribute to the recovery of neurological function. Over the past few decades, studies have found that macrophages/microglia are one of the primary effector cells in the inflammatory response following SCI. Growing evidence has documented that macrophages/microglia are plastic cells that can polarize in response to microenvironmental signals into M1 and M2 macrophages/microglia. M1 produces pro-inflammatory cytokines to induce inflammation and worsen tissue damage, while M2 has anti-inflammatory activities in wound healing and tissue regeneration. Recent studies have indicated that the transition from the M1 to the M2 phenotype of macrophage/microglia supports the regression of inflammation and tissue repair. Here, we will review the role of the inflammatory response and macrophages/microglia in SCI and repair. In addition, we will discuss potential molecular mechanisms that induce macrophage/microglia polarization, with emphasis on neuroprotective therapies that modulate macrophage/microglia polarization, which will provide new insights into therapeutic strategies for SCI."
Mevalonate Cascade and Small Rho GTPase in Spinal Cord Injury,"Eftekharpour E, Nagakannan P, Iqbal MA, Chen QM.","AB  - The mevalonate pathway has been extensively studied for its involvement in cholesterol synthesis. Inhibition of this pathway using statins (3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors; HMGR inhibitors) is the primarily selected method due to its cholesterol-lowering effect, making statins the most commonly used (86-94%) cholesterol-lowering drugs in adults. This pathway has several other by-products that are affected by statins including GTPase molecules (guanine triphosphate-binding kinases), such as Rho/Rho-associated coiled kinase (ROCK) kinases, that are implicated in other diseases, including those of the central nervous system (CNS). These molecules control several aspects of neural cell life including axonal growth, cellular migration, and cell death, and therefore, are of increasing interest in the field of spinal cord injury (SCI). Limited regeneration capacity of nerve fibers in adult CNS has been considered the main obstacle for finding a SCI cure. Over the past two decades, the identity of inhibitory factors for regeneration has been widely investigated. It is well-established that the Rho/ROCK kinase system is specifically activated by the components of damaged spinal cord tissue, including oligodendrocytes and myelin, as well as extracellular matrix. This has led many groups to hypothesize that statin therapy may in fact enhance the current neurorestorative approaches. In this mini-review, a summary of SCI pathophysiology is discussed and the current literature targeting the regeneration obstacles in SCI are reviewed, with special attention to recent publications of the past decade. In addition, we focus on the current literature involving the use of pharmacological and molecular inhibitors of small GTPase molecules for treatment of neurotrauma. Inhibiting these molecules has been shown to increase neuroprotection, enhance axonal regeneration, and facilitate the implementation of cell replacement therapies. Based upon available literature, the need for clinical trials involving targeted inhibition of GTPase molecules remains strong. Some of these drugs are widely used for other diseases, and therefore re-purposing their application for neurotrauma can be fasttracked. These approaches can potentially modify the inhibitory environment of nervous tissue to allow the spontaneous repair capacity of injured tissue."
Research advances of biomaterials-based microenvironment-regulation therapies for repair and regeneration of spinal cord injury,"Li Z, Wang Q, Hu H, Zheng W, Gao C.","AB  - Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) usually results in restricted behaviour recovery and even life-changing paralysis, accompanied with numerous complications. Pathologically, the initial injuries trigger a series of secondary injuries, leading to an expansion of lesion site, a mass of neuron loss, and eventual failure of endogenous axon regeneration. As the advances rapidly spring up in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering biomaterials, regulation of these secondary injuries becomes possible, shedding a light on normal functional restoration. The successful tissue regeneration lies in proper regulation of the inflammatory microenvironment, including the inflammatory immune cells and inflammatory factors that lead to oxidative stress, inhibitory glial scar and neuroexcitatory toxicity. Specifically, the approaches based on microenvironment-regulating biomaterials have shown great promise in the repair and regeneration of SCI. In this review, the pathological inflammatory microenvironments of SCI are discussed, followed by the introduction of microenvironment-regulating biomaterials in terms of their impressive therapeutic effect in attenuation of secondary inflammation and promotion of axon regrowth. With the emphasis on regulating secondary events, the biomaterials for SCI treatment will become promising for clinical applications."
"Versatile subtypes of pericytes and their roles in spinal cord injury repair, bone development and repair","Zhu S, Chen M, Ying Y, Wu Q, Huang Z, Ni W, Wang X, Xu H, Bennett S, Xiao J, Xu J.","AB  - Vascular regeneration is a challenging topic in tissue repair. As one of the important components of the neurovascular unit (NVU), pericytes play an essential role in the maintenance of the vascular network of the spinal cord. To date, subtypes of pericytes have been identified by various markers, namely the PDGFR-β, Desmin, CD146, and NG2, each of which is involved with spinal cord injury (SCI) repair. In addition, pericytes may act as a stem cell source that is important for bone development and regeneration, whilst specific subtypes of pericyte could facilitate bone fracture and defect repair. One of the major challenges of pericyte biology is to determine the specific markers that would clearly distinguish the different subtypes of pericytes, and to develop efficient approaches to isolate and propagate pericytes. In this review, we discuss the biology and roles of pericytes, their markers for identification, and cell differentiation capacity with a focus on the potential application in the treatment of SCI and bone diseases in orthopedics."
The Emerging Role of lncRNAs in Spinal Cord Injury,"Wang F, Liu J, Wang X, Chen J, Kong Q, Ye B, Li Z.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a highly debilitating disease and is increasingly being recognized as an important global health priority. However, the mechanisms underlying SCI have not yet been fully elucidated, and effective therapies for SCI are lacking. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which form a major class of noncoding RNAs, have emerged as novel targets for regulating several physiological functions and mediating numerous neurological diseases. Notably, gene expression profile analyses have demonstrated aberrant changes in lncRNA expression in rats or mice after traumatic or nontraumatic SCI. LncRNAs have been shown to be associated with multiple pathophysiological processes following SCI including inflammation, neural apoptosis, and oxidative stress. They also play a crucial role in the complications associated with SCI, such as neuropathic pain. At the same time, some lncRNAs have been found to be therapeutic targets for neural stem cell transplantation and hydrogen sulfide treatment aimed at alleviating SCI. Therefore, lncRNAs could be promising biomarkers for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of SCI. However, further researches are required to clarify the therapeutic effects of lncRNAs on SCI and the mechanisms underlying these effects. In this study, we reviewed the current progress of the studies on the involvement of lncRNAs in SCI, with the aim of drawing attention towards their roles in this debilitating condition."
Motor functional recovery efficacy of scaffolds with bone marrow stem cells in rat spinal cord injury: a Bayesian network meta-analysis,"Zhang D, Sun Y, Liu W.","AB  - Advances in medical and rehabilitative care now allow the 10-12,000 individuals who suffer spinal cord injuries each year in the United States to lead productive lives of nearly normal life expectancy, so that the numbers of those with chronic injuries will approximate 300,000 at the end of the next decade. This signals an urgent need for new treatments that will improve repair and recovery after longstanding injuries. In the present report we consider the characteristics of the chronically injured spinal cord that make it an even more challenging setting in which to elicit regeneration than the acutely injured spinal cord and review the treatments that have been designed to enhance axon growth. When applied in the first 2 weeks after experimental spinal cord injury, transplants, usually in combination with supplementary neurotrophic factors, and possibly modifications of the inhibitory central nervous system environment, have produced limited long-distance axon regeneration and behavioral recovery. When applied to injuries older than 4 weeks, the same treatments have almost invariably failed to overcome the obstacles posed by the neurons' diminished capacity for regeneration and by the increasing hostility to growth of the terrain at and beyond the injury site. Novel treatments that have stimulated regeneration after acute injuries have not yet been applied to chronic injuries. A therapeutic strategy that combines rehabilitation training and pharmacological modulation of neurotransmitters appears to be a particularly promising approach to increasing recovery after longstanding injury. Identifying patients with no hope of useful recovery in the early days after injury will allow these treatments to be administered as early as possible."
Repair of chronic spinal cord injury,"Houle JD, Tessler A.","AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A Bayesian network meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: Spinal cord injury (SCI) can profoundly influence human health and has been linked to lifelong disability. More high-level evidence-based medical research is expected to evaluate the value of stem cells and biomaterial scaffold material therapy for SCI. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive search of Web of Science, Cochrane databases, Embase, and PubMed databases. 18 randomized controlled trials including both scaffolds and BMSCs were included. We performed a Bayesian network meta-analysis to compare the motor functional recovery efficacy of different scaffolds with BMSCs in rat SCI. RESULTS: In our Bayesian network meta-analysis, the motor functional recovery was found to benefit from scaffolds, BMSCs, and BMSCs combined with scaffolds, but the scaffold and BMSC groups had similar motor functional recovery efficacy, and the BMSCs combined with scaffolds group appeared to show better efficacy than BMSCs and scaffolds alone. Subgroup analysis showed that BMSCs+fibrin, BMSCs+ASC, BMSCs+gelatine, and BMSCs+collagen were the best four treatments for SCI in rat models. CONCLUSIONS: These Bayesian network meta-analysis findings strongly indicated that BMSCs combined with scaffolds is more effective to improve motor functional recovery than BMSCs and scaffolds alone. The fibrin, gelatine, ASC, and collagen may be favourable scaffolds for the injured spinal cord and that scaffolds with BMSCs could be a promising option in regeneration therapy for patients with SCI."
Human Pluripotent-Derived Lineages for Repairing Hypopituitarism,"Studer L, Tabar V.","AB  - Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) present a potentially unlimited source of specialized cell types for regenerative medicine. Over the last few years there has been rapid progress in realizing this potential by developing protocols to generate disease-relevant cell types in vitro on demand. The approach was particularly successful for the nervous system, where the field is at the verge of human translation for several indications, including the treatment of eye disorders, Parkinson’s disease and spinal cord injury. More recently, there has also been success in deriving anterior pituitary lineages from both mouse and human pluripotent stem cells. In vitro-derived pituitary hormone-producing cell types present an attractive source for repair in patients with hypopituitarism. However, several hurdles remain towards realizing this goal. In particular, there is a need to further improve the efficiency and precision with which specific hormone-producing lineages can be derived. Furthermore, it will be important to assess the potential of both ectopic and orthotopic transplantation strategies to achieve meaningful hormone replacement. The ultimate challenge will be repair that moves beyond hormone replacement towards the full functional integration of the grafted cells into the complex regulatory endocrine network controlled by the human pituitary gland."
Regenerative medicine for neurological diseases-will regenerative neurosurgery deliver?,"Burns TC, Quinones-Hinojosa A.","AB  - Regenerative medicine aspires to transform the future practice of medicine by providing curative, rather than palliative, treatments. Healing the central nervous system (CNS) remains among regenerative medicine's most highly prized but formidable challenges. Regenerative neurosurgery"" provides access to the CNS or its surrounding structures to preserve or restore neurological function. Pioneering efforts over the past three decades have introduced cells"
Mechanism and prospects of mitochondrial transplantation for spinal cord injury treatment,"Wang Q, Wang X, Shang Z, Zhao L.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) involves a continuous and dynamic cascade of complex reactions, with mitochondrial damage and dysfunction-induced energy metabolism disorders playing a central role throughout the process. These disorders not only determine the severity of secondary injuries but also influence the potential for axonal regeneration. Given the critical role of energy metabolism disturbances in the pathology of SCI, strategies such as enhancing mitochondrial transport within axons to alleviate local energy deficits, or transplanting autologous or allogeneic mitochondria to restore energy supply to damaged tissues, have emerged as potential approaches for SCI repair. These strategies also aim to modulate local inflammatory responses and apoptosis. Preclinical studies have initially demonstrated that mitochondrial transplantation (MT) significantly reduces neuronal death and promotes axonal regeneration following spinal cord injury. MT achieves this by regulating signaling pathways such as MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt, promoting the expression of growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) in neurons, and inhibiting the expression of apoptosis-related proteins like Grp78, Chop, and P-Akt, thereby enhancing the survival and regeneration of damaged neurons. Additionally, MT plays a role in promoting the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, facilitating tissue repair, and reducing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. Furthermore, MT modulates neuronal apoptosis and inflammatory responses by decreasing the expression of p-JNK, a member of the MAPK family. In summary, by reviewing the detailed mechanisms underlying the cascade of pathological processes in SCI, we emphasize the changes in endogenous mitochondria post-SCI and the potential of exogenous MT in SCI repair. This review aims to provide insights and a basis for developing more effective clinical treatments for SCI."
Tracing the evolving dynamics and research hotspots of spinal cord injury and surgical decompression from 1975 to 2024: a bibliometric analysis,"Wang S, Xu W, Wang J, Hu X, Wu Z, Li C, Xiao Z, Ma B, Cheng L.","AB  - BACKGROUND: Exploration of the benefits and timing of surgical decompression in spinal cord injury (SCI) has been a research hotspot. However, despite the higher volume and increasing emphasis on quality there remains no bibliometric view on SCI and surgical decompression. In this study, we aimed to perform bibliometric analysis to reveal the core countries, affiliations, journals, authors, and developmental trends in SCI and surgical decompression across the past 50 years. METHODS: Articles and reviews were retrieved from web of science core collection between 1975 and 2024. The bibliometrix package in R was used for data analysis and visualizing. RESULTS: A total of 8,688 documents were investigated, indicating an ascending trend in annual publications. The USA and China played as the leaders in scientific productivity. The University of Toronto led in institutional productions. Core authors, such as Michael G. Fehlings, showed high productivity, and occasional authors showed widespread interests. Core journals like Spine and Spinal Cord served as beacons in this field. The interaction of core authors and international collaboration accentuated the cross-disciplinary feature of the field. Prominent documents emphasized the clinical significance of early decompression in 24 h post SCI. CONCLUSION: Based on comprehensive bibliometric analysis and literature review, we identified the hotspots and future directions of this field: (1) further investigation into the molecular and cellular mechanisms to provide pre-clinical evidence for biological effects of early surgical decompression in SCI animal models; (2) further evaluation and validation of the optimal time window of surgical decompression based on large cohort, considering the inherent heterogeneity of subpopulations in complicated immune responses post SCI; (3) further exploration on the benefits of early decompression on the neurological, functional, and clinical outcomes in acute SCI; (4) evaluation of the optimal surgical methods and related outcomes; (5) applications of artificial intelligence-based technologies in spinal surgical decompression."
Neurorehabilitation with neural transplantation,"Döbrössy M, Busse M, Piroth T, Rosser A, Dunnett S, Nikkhah G.","AB  - Oligodendrocytes play a fundamental supportive role in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) as the myelinating-glial cells. Disruption of fast axonal transport mechanisms can occur as a consequence of mature oligodendrocyte loss following spinal cord injury, stroke, or due to neuroinflammatory conditions, such as multiple sclerosis. As a result of the limited remyelination ability in the CNS after injury or disease, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) may prove to be a promising option for the generation and replacement of mature oligodendrocytes. Moreover, hESC-derived oligodendrocytes may be experimentally utilized to unravel fundamental questions of oligodendrocyte development, along with their therapeutic potential through growth factor support of axons and neurons. However, an intensive characterization and examination of hESC-derived oligodendrocytes prior to preclinical or clinical trials is required to facilitate greater success in their integration following cellular replacement therapy (CRT). Currently, the protocols utilized to derive oligodendrocytes from hESCs consist of significant variations in culture style, time-length of differentiation, and the provision of growth factors in culture. Further, these differing protocols also report disparate patterns in the expression of oligodendroglial markers by these derived oligodendrocytes, throughout their differentiation in culture. We have comprehensively reviewed the published protocols describing the derivation of oligodendrocytes from hESCs and the studies that examine their efficacy to remyelinate, along with the fundamental issues of their safety as a viable CRT. Additionally, this review will highlight particular issues of concern and suggestions for troubleshooting to provide investigators critical information for the future improvement of establishing in vitro hESC-derived oligodendrocytes."
Endogenous and exogenous CNS derived stem/progenitor cell approaches for neurotrauma,"Kulbatski I, Mothe AJ, Nomura H, Tator CH.","AB  - Cell replacement therapy has been tested clinically in Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD), epilepsy, spinal cord injury, and stroke. The clinical outcomes have been variable, perhaps partly because of the differing levels of preclinical, basic experimental evidence that was available prior to the trials. The most promising results have been seen in PD trials, with encouraging ones in HD. A common feature of most trials is that they have concentrated on the biological and technical aspects of transplantation without presupposing that the outcomes might be influenced by events after the surgery. The growing evidence of plasticity demonstrated by the brain and grafts in response to environmental and training stimuli such as rehabilitation interventions has been mostly neglected throughout the clinical application of cell therapy. This review suggests that a different approach may be required to maximize recovery: postoperative experiences, including rehabilitation with explicit behavioral retraining, could have marked direct as well as positive secondary effects on the integration and function of grafted cells in the host neural system. The knowledge gained about brain plasticity following brain damage needs to be linked with what we know about promoting intrinsic recovery processes and how this can boost neurobiological and surgical strategies for repair at the clinical level. With proof of principle now established, a rich area for innovative research with profound therapeutic application is open for investigation."
Techniques of Human Embryonic Stem Cell and Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Derivation,"Lewandowski J, Kurpisz M.","AB  - Neural stem/progenitor cells capable of generating new neurons and glia, reside in specific areas of the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS), including the ependymal region of the spinal cord and the subventricular zone (SVZ), hippocampus, and dentate gyrus of the brain. Much is known about the neurogenic regions in the CNS, and their response to various stimuli including injury, neurotrophins (NFs), morphogens, and environmental factors like learning, stress, and aging. This work has shaped our current views about the CNS's potential to recover lost tissue and function post-traumatically and the therapies to support the intrinsic regenerative capacity of the brain or spinal cord. Recently, intensive research has explored the potential of harvesting, culturing, and transplanting neural stem/progenitors as a therapeutic intervention for spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Another strategy has focused on maximizing the potential of this endogenous population of cells by stimulating their recruitment, proliferation, migration, and differentiation in vivo following traumatic lesions to the CNS. The promise of such experimental treatments has prompted tissue and biomaterial engineers to implant synthetic three-dimensional biodegradable scaffolds seeded with neural stem/progenitors into CNS lesions. Although there is no definitive answer about the ideal cell type for transplantation, strong evidence supports the use of region specific neural stem/progenitors. The technical and logistic considerations for transplanting neural stem/progenitors are extensive and crucial to optimizing and maintaining cell survival both before and after transplantation, as well as for tracking the fate of transplanted cells. These issues have been systematically addressed in many animal models, that has improved our understanding and approach to clinical therapeutic paradigms."
Human embryonic stem cell-derived oligodendrocytes: protocols and perspectives,"Alsanie WF, Niclis JC, Petratos S.","AB  - Developing procedures for the derivation of human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) gave rise to novel pathways into regenerative medicine research. For many years, stem cells have attracted attention as a potentially unlimited cell source for cellular therapy in neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and spinal cord injuries, for example. In these studies, adult stem cells were insufficient; therefore, many attempts were made to obtain PSCs by other means. This review discusses key issues concerning the techniques of pluripotent cell acquisition. Technical and ethical issues hindered the medical use of somatic cell nuclear transfer and embryonic stem cells. Therefore, induced PSCs (iPSCs) emerged as a powerful technique with great potential for clinical applications, patient-specific disease modelling and pharmaceutical studies. The replacement of viral vectors or the administration of analogous proteins or chemical compounds during cell reprogramming are modifications designed to reduce tumorigenesis risk and to augment the procedure efficiency. Intensified analysis of new PSC lines revealed other barriers to overcome, such as epigenetic memory, disparity between human and mouse pluripotency, and variable response to differentiation of some iPSC lines. Thus, multidimensional verification must be conducted to fulfil strict clinical-grade requirements. Nevertheless, the first clinical trials in patients with spinal cord injury and macular dystrophy were recently carried out with differentiated iPSCs, encouraging alternative strategies for potential autologous cellular therapies."
Therapeutic potential of embryonic stem cells,"Lerou PH, Daley GQ.","AB  - Nearly 20 years after murine embryonic stem cells (mESC) were isolated, the first report of the derivation of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) in 1998 spawned the field of hESC research [Evans MJ, Kaufman MH, Establishment in culture of pluripotential cells from mouse embryos. Nature 1981; 292 (5819): 154-6; Thomson JA, Itskovitz-Eldor J, Shapiro SS, et al. Embryonic stem cell lines derived from human blastocysts. Science 1998; 282 (5391): 1145-7.]. Although this field is only in its infancy, hESC represent a theoretically inexhaustible source of precursor cells that could be differentiated into any cell type to treat degenerative, malignant, or genetic diseases, or injury due to inflammation, infection, and trauma. This pluripotent, endlessly dividing cell has been hailed as a possible means for treating diabetes, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, spinal cord injury, heart failure, and bone marrow failure. But the regenerative medicine applications of embryonic stem cells are only one facet of hESC therapeutic potential. Human ESC are an invaluable research tool to study development, both normal and abnormal, and can serve as a platform to develop and test new therapies. In addition to discussing the therapeutic potential of hESC, this chapter will cover limitations to using hESC for replacement cell therapy, strategies to overcome these limitations, and alternative methods of deriving hESC."
Stem cell-based therapy for human diseases,"Hoang DM, Pham PT, Bach TQ, Ngo ATL, Nguyen QT, Phan TTK, Nguyen GH, Le PTT, Hoang VT, Forsyth NR, Heke M, Nguyen LT.","AB  - Recent advancements in stem cell technology open a new door for patients suffering from diseases and disorders that have yet to be treated. Stem cell-based therapy, including human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), has recently emerged as a key player in regenerative medicine. hPSCs are defined as self-renewable cell types conferring the ability to differentiate into various cellular phenotypes of the human body, including three germ layers. MSCs are multipotent progenitor cells possessing self-renewal ability (limited in vitro) and differentiation potential into mesenchymal lineages, according to the International Society for Cell and Gene Therapy (ISCT). This review provides an update on recent clinical applications using either hPSCs or MSCs derived from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue (AT), or the umbilical cord (UC) for the treatment of human diseases, including neurological disorders, pulmonary dysfunctions, metabolic/endocrine-related diseases, reproductive disorders, skin burns, and cardiovascular conditions. Moreover, we discuss our own clinical trial experiences on targeted therapies using MSCs in a clinical setting, and we propose and discuss the MSC tissue origin concept and how MSC origin may contribute to the role of MSCs in downstream applications, with the ultimate objective of facilitating translational research in regenerative medicine into clinical applications. The mechanisms discussed here support the proposed hypothesis that BM-MSCs are potentially good candidates for brain and spinal cord injury treatment, AT-MSCs are potentially good candidates for reproductive disorder treatment and skin regeneration, and UC-MSCs are potentially good candidates for pulmonary disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome treatment."
Cell replacement therapy in neurological disease,"Goldman SA, Windrem MS.","AB  - Diseases of the brain and spinal cord represent especially daunting challenges for cell-based strategies of repair, given the multiplicity of cell types within the adult central nervous system, and the precision with which they must interact in both space and time. Nonetheless, a number of diseases are especially appropriate for cell-based therapy, in particular those in which single phenotypes are lost, and in which the re-establishment of vectorially specific connections is not entirely requisite for therapeutic benefit. We review here a set of potential therapeutic indications that meet these criteria as potentially benefiting from the transplantation of neural stem and progenitor cells. These include: (i) transplantation of phenotypically restricted neuronal progenitor cells into diseases of a single neuronal phenotype, such as Parkinson's disease; (ii) implantation of mixed progenitor pools into diseases characterized by the loss of a limited number of discrete phenotypes, such as spinal cord injury and the motor neuronopathies; (iii) transplantation of glial and nominally oligodendrocytic progenitor cells as a means of treating disorders of myelin; and (iv) transplantation of neural stem cells as a means of treating lysosomal storage disorders and other diseases of enzymatic deficiency. Among the diseases potentially approachable by these strategies, the myelin disorders, including the paediatric leucodystrophies as well as adult traumatic and inflammatory demyelinations, may present the most compelling targets for cell-based neurological therapy."
Umbilical cord blood derived cell expansion: a potential neuroprotective therapy,"Penny TR, Jenkin G, Miller SL, McDonald CA.","AB  - Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is a rich source of beneficial stem and progenitor cells with known angiogenic, neuroregenerative and immune-modulatory properties. Preclinical studies have highlighted the benefit of UCB for a broad range of conditions including haematological conditions, metabolic disorders and neurological conditions, however clinical translation of UCB therapies is lacking. One barrier for clinical translation is inadequate cell numbers in some samples meaning that often a therapeutic dose cannot be achieved. This is particularly important when treating adults or when administering repeat doses of cells. To overcome this, UCB cell expansion is being explored to increase cell numbers. The current focus of UCB cell expansion is CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) for which the main application is treatment of haematological conditions. Currently there are 36 registered clinical trials that are examining the efficacy of expanded UCB cells with 31 of these being for haematological malignancies. Early data from these trials suggest that expanded UCB cells are a safe and feasible treatment option and show greater engraftment potential than unexpanded UCB. Outside of the haematology research space, expanded UCB has been trialled as a therapy in only two preclinical studies, one for spinal cord injury and one for hind limb ischemia. Proteomic analysis of expanded UCB cells in these studies showed that the cells were neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory and angiogenic. These findings are also supported by in vitro studies where expanded UCB CD34+ cells showed increased gene expression of neurotrophic and angiogenic factors compared to unexpanded CD34+ cells. Preclinical evidence demonstrates that unexpanded CD34+ cells are a promising therapy for neurological conditions where they have been shown to improve multiple indices of injury in rodent models of stroke, Parkinson's disease and neonatal hypoxic ischemic brain injury. This review will highlight the current application of expanded UCB derived HSCs in transplant medicine, and also explore the potential use of expanded HSCs as a therapy for neurological conditions. It is proposed that expanded UCB derived CD34+ cells are an appropriate cellular therapy for a range of neurological conditions in children and adults."
Evaluation of clinical experience using cell-based therapies in patients with spinal cord injury: a systematic review,"Harrop JS, Hashimoto R, Norvell D, Raich A, Aarabi B, Grossman RG, Guest JD, Tator CH, Chapman J, Fehlings MG.","AB  - Gene modification of cells prior to their transplantation, especially stem cells, enhances their survival and increases their function in cell therapy. Like the Trojan horse, the gene-modified cell has to gain entrance inside the host's walls and survive and deliver its transgene products. Using cellular, molecular and gene manipulation techniques the transplanted cell can be protected in a hostile environment from immune rejection, inflammation, hypoxia and apoptosis. Genetic engineering to modify cells involves constructing modules of functional gene sequences. They can be simple reporter genes or complex cassettes with gene switches, cell specific promoters and multiple transgenes. We discuss methods to deliver and construct gene cassettes with viral and non-viral delivery, siRNA, and conditional Cre/Lox P. We review the current uses of gene-modified stem cells in cardiovascular disease, diabetes, neurological diseases, (including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and spinal cord injury repair), bone defects, hemophilia, and cancer."
Genetic modification of stem cells for transplantation,"Phillips MI, Tang YL.","AB  - OBJECT: Using a systematic approach, the authors evaluated the current utilization, safety, and effectiveness of cellular therapies for traumatic spinal cord injuries (SCIs) in humans. METHODS: A systematic search and critical review of the literature published through mid-January 2012 was performed. Articles included in the search were restricted to the English language, studies with at least 10 patients, and those analyzing cellular therapies for traumatic SCI. Citations were evaluated for relevance using a priori criteria, and those that met the inclusion criteria were critically reviewed. Each article was then designated a level of evidence that was developed by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. RESULTS: The initial literature search identified 651 relevant articles, which decreased to 350 after excluding case reports and reviews. Evaluation of articles at the title/abstract level, and later at the full-text level, limited the final article set to 12 papers. The following cellular therapies employed in humans with SCI are reviewed: bone marrow mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem cells (8 studies), olfactory ensheathing cells (2 studies), Schwann cells (1 study), and fetal neurogenic tissue (1 study). Overall the quality of the literature was very low, with 3 Grade III levels of evidence and 9 Grade IV studies. CONCLUSIONS: Several different cellular-mediated strategies for adult SCI have been reported to be relatively safe with varying degrees of neurological recovery. However, the literature is of low quality and there is a need for improved preclinical studies and prospective, controlled clinical trials."
Mesenchymal Stem Cells: New Alternatives for Nervous System Disorders,"Jiménez-Acosta MA, Hernández LJR, Cristerna MLP, Meraz-Ríos MA.","AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are self-renewing cells found in almost all postnatal organs and tissues in the perivascular region. These cells have a high capacity for mesodermal differentiation; however, numerous studies have shown that MSCs can also differentiate into cells of endodermal and ectodermal lineages. Due to this multilineage differentiation capacity, these cells could function as restoratives of various cell populations after transplantation. However, not only their differentiation potential makes them ideal candidates for this, but also a series of trophic properties that promote regeneration in the surrounding tissue, such as their migratory capacity, secretory and immunomodulatory actions. This review analyzes several MSC transplantation trials to treat neurological diseases, such as demyelinating injury, spinal cord injury, paraplegia, Parkinson's disease, cochlear injury, and Alzheimer's disease. These cells could facilitate functional recovery in multiple models of neurodegenerative diseases and nervous system injuries by using their trophic capacities, reducing inflammation in the injured area, reducing apoptosis, and enhancing endogenous neurogenesis through the secretion of bioactive factors. Furthermore, since cells derived from patients have demonstrated disease-associated differences in various brain diseases, these cells represent an excellent candidate for the study of these diseases, functioning as a window to the brain."""""
The use of erythropoietin and its derivatives to treat spinal cord injury,"Mofidi A, Bader A, Pavlica S.","AB  - Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) is a complex process which leads to destruction of neuronal tissue and also vascular structure. After SCI many potentially toxic substances are activated and released into the injury site causing secondary degeneration. Erythropoietin (EPO) is a possible therapeutic strategy to treat SCI. Over the last decade attention has been focused on the molecular mechanisms underlying its neuroprotective effects. A major concern expressed by clinicians is that besides its protective effects, EPO also demonstrates hematopoietic activity and increases the risk for thrombosis after the administration of multiple doses of this glycoprotein. Recently, tissue protective functions of EPO have been separated from its hematopoietic actions leading to the development of EPO derivatives and mimetics. Neuroscientists are focusing on recombinant human EPO (rhEPO) and its non-erythropoietic derivatives, investigating their anti-apoptotic potential and anti-inflammatory function as well as their role in restoring vascular integrity. Carbamylated erythropoietin (CEPO) and asialo erythropoietin (AsialoEPO) are structural derivatives of EPO that have no effect on erythrocyte mass whereas they retained its neuroprotective effects. In this review article, we provide a short overview of the animal studies on rhEPO and its derivatives in experimental models of SCI. Both the efficacy and the safety profile of EPO-structural and functional variants are still to be demonstrated in patients. Further clinical studies should reveal whether derivatives and variants of erythropoietin provide any benefits over the use of rhEPO in the treatment of spinal cord injury observed in the experimental studies."
Pluripotent stem cell applications for regenerative medicine,"Angelos MG, Kaufman DS.","AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this review, we summarize the current status of clinical trials using therapeutic cells produced from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). We also discuss combined cell and gene therapy via correction of defined mutations in human pluripotent stem cells and provide commentary on key obstacles facing widescale clinical adoption of pluripotent stem cell-based therapy. RECENT FINDINGS: Initial data suggest that hESC/hiPSC-derived cell products used for retinal repair and spinal cord injury are safe for human use. Early-stage studies for treatment of cardiac injury and diabetes are also in progress. However, there remain key concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of these cells that need to be addressed in additional well designed clinical trials. Advances using the clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 gene-editing system offer an improved tool for more rapid and on-target gene correction of genetic diseases. Combined gene and cell therapy using human pluripotent stem cells may provide an additional curative approach for disabling or lethal genetic and degenerative diseases wherein there are currently limited therapeutic opportunities. SUMMARY: Human pluripotent stem cells are emerging as a promising tool to produce cells and tissues suitable for regenerative therapy for a variety of genetic and degenerative diseases."
Mesenchymal stem cells as mediators of neural differentiation,"Hardy SA, Maltman DJ, Przyborski SA.","AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represent a promising source of material for autologous cell transplantation therapies, in particular, their potential use for the treatment of damaged nervous tissue. Much of the work in this area has focused on the transplantation of MSCs into animal models of neurological disorders, including stroke and spinal cord injury. Although numerous studies have reported significant functional improvements in these systems, the exact mechanism(s) by which MSCs elicit recovery remains largely undefined. While it has been proposed that 'trans'-differentiation and/or cell fusion events underly MSC-mediated neural repair, there is considerable doubt that the low frequency of these phenomena is sufficient to account for the observed levels of recovery. Furthermore, in vitro studies call into question the ability of MSCs to produce authentic neural derivatives. In this review we focus on recent evidence indicating that transplanted MSCs promote endogenous repair of neurologically damaged areas via the release of soluble trophic factors and cytokines. Through the modern analysis of MSC-conditioned media it is becoming possible to gain new insight into the release and interplay of these soluble factors and their neurogenic effects. Ultimately this understanding may lead to the rational design of new therapies for the treatment of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders."
Therapeutic Hypothermia in Spinal Cord Injury: The Status of Its Use and Open Questions,"Wang J, Pearse DD.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a major health problem and is associated with a diversity of neurological symptoms. Pathophysiologically, dysfunction after SCI results from the culmination of tissue damage produced both by the primary insult and a range of secondary injury mechanisms. The application of hypothermia has been demonstrated to be neuroprotective after SCI in both experimental and human studies. The myriad of protective mechanisms of hypothermia include the slowing down of metabolism, decreasing free radical generation, inhibiting excitotoxicity and apoptosis, ameliorating inflammation, preserving the blood spinal cord barrier, inhibiting astrogliosis, promoting angiogenesis, as well as decreasing axonal damage and encouraging neurogenesis. Hypothermia has also been combined with other interventions, such as antioxidants, anesthetics, alkalinization and cell transplantation for additional benefit. Although a large body of work has reported on the effectiveness of hypothermia as a neuroprotective approach after SCI and its application has been translated to the clinic, a number of questions still remain regarding its use, including the identification of hypothermia's therapeutic window, optimal duration and the most appropriate rewarming rate. In addition, it is necessary to investigate the neuroprotective effect of combining therapeutic hypothermia with other treatment strategies for putative synergies, particularly those involving neurorepair."
Deciphering the oligodendrogenic program of neural progenitors: cell intrinsic and extrinsic regulators,"Rivera FJ, Steffenhagen C, Kremer D, Kandasamy M, Sandner B, Couillard-Despres S, Weidner N, Küry P, Aigner L.","AB  - In 2006, we demonstrated that mature somatic cells can be reprogrammed to a pluripotent state by gene transfer, generating induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Since that time, there has been an enormous increase in interest regarding the application of iPS cell technologies to medical science, in particular for regenerative medicine and human disease modeling. In this review article, we outline the current status of applications of iPS technology to cell therapies (particularly for spinal cord injury), as well as neurological disease-specific iPS cell research (particularly for Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease). Finally, future directions of iPS cell research are discussed including a) development of an accurate assay system for disease-associated phenotypes, b) demonstration of causative relationships between genotypes and phenotypes by genome editing, c) application to sporadic and common diseases, and d) application to preemptive medicine."
iPS cell technologies: significance and applications to CNS regeneration and disease,"Okano H, Yamanaka S.","AB  - In the developing and adult CNS, neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) and oligodendroglial progenitor cells (OPCs) follow an oligodendrogenic process with the aim of myelinating axons. This process is to a high degree regulated by an oligodendrogenic program (OPr) composed of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that modulate the different steps required for NSPCs to differentiate into myelinating oligodendrocytes. Even though NSPCs and OPCs are present in the diseased CNS and have the capacity to generate oligodendrocytes, sparse remyelination of axons constitutes a major constraint in therapies toward multiple sclerosis (MS) and spinal cord injury (SCI). Lack of pro-oligodendrogenic factors and presence of anti-oligodendrogenic activities are thought to be the main reasons for this limitation. Thus, molecular and cellular strategies aiming at remyelination and at targeting such pro- and anti-oligodendrogenic mechanisms are currently under investigation. The present review summarizes the current knowledge on the OPr; it implements our own findings on mesenchymal stem cell-derived pro-oligodendroglial factors and on the role of p57/kip2 in oligodendroglial differentiation. Moreover, it describes molecular and cellular approaches for the development of future therapies toward remyelination."
From tendon to nerve: an MSC for all seasons,"Jamnig A, Lepperdinger G.","AB  - The potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to regenerate damaged tissue is well documented, as this specialized progenitor cell type exhibits superior cellular properties, and would allow medical as well as ethical limitations to be overcome. By now, MSCs have been successfully introduced in manifold experimental approaches within the newly defined realm of Regenerative Medicine. Advanced methods for in vitro cell expansion, defined induction of distinct differentiation processes, 3-dimensional culture on specific scaffold material, and tissue engineering approaches have been designed, and many clinical trials not only have been launched, but recently could be completed. To date, most of the MSC-based therapeutic approaches have been executed to address bone, cartilage, or heart regeneration; further, prominent studies have shown the efficacy of ex vivo expanded and infused MSCs to countervail graft-versus-host disease. Yet more fields of application emerge in which MSCs unfold beneficial effects, and presently, therapies that effectively ameliorate nonhealing conditions after tendon or spinal cord injury are, courtesy of scientific research, forging ahead to the clinical trial stage."
Mesenchymal stem cells as a source of Schwann cells: their anticipated use in peripheral nerve regeneration,"Wakao S, Matsuse D, Dezawa M.","AB  - Schwann cells form myelin, sustain axons and provide the microenvironment for nerve fibers, thereby playing a key role in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Schwann cells also provide support for the damaged PNS by producing factors that strongly promote axonal regrowth and contribute to remyelination, which is crucial for the recovery of neural function. These advantages are not confined to the PNS and also apply to the central nervous system. Many diseases, including peripheral nerve injury, neuropathy, multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury, are targets for Schwann cell therapy. The collection of Schwann cells, however, causes new damage to other peripheral nerve segments. Furthermore, the doubling time of Schwann cells is not very fast, and thus adequate amounts of Schwann cells for clinical use cannot be collected within a reasonable amount of time. Mesenchymal stem cells, which are highly proliferative, are easily accessible from various types of mesenchymal tissues, such as the bone marrow, umbilical cord and fat tissue. Because these cells have the ability to cross oligolineage boundaries between mesodermal to ectodermal lineages, they are capable of differentiating into Schwann cells with step-by-step cytokine stimulation. In this review, we summarize the properties of mesenchymal stem cell-derived Schwann cells, which are comparable to authentic Schwann cells, and discuss future perspectives."
The 'current state of play' in transplantation and restoration research of the CNS,"Eve DJ, Sanberg PR.","AB  - At the Network of European CNS Transplantation and Restoration 2005 meeting, a number of revealing studies were reported that could be divided into two broad, overlapping groups; methods to maximize the efficacy of cell transplants in vitro and their use in vivo. A variety of different forms of stem cells ranging from embryonic stem cells to cells expressing specific genes following lentiviral vector transduction were investigated. Methods to improve the efficacy of transplants included the cotransplantation of other cell lines, exposure of the recipient to an enriched environment and methods to promote differentiation. The majority of the studies, if disease-specific, related to Parkinson's disease, but additional reports on Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease and spinal cord injury were also present. A few studies related to different animal models of disease. Overall the future for transplantation and restoration of functional activity in diseased states is very promising."
Therapeutic potential of olfactory ensheathing cells in neurodegenerative diseases,"Chiu SC, Hung HS, Lin SZ, Chiang E, Liu DD.","AB  - The regenerative capacity of the olfactory system has generated interest in potential clinical application of cells from the olfactory epithelium in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Experimental evidence from animal models and clinical studies suggest that transplantation of olfactory ensheathing cells (OEC), specialized glia in the olfactory system, may be therapeutically useful in neurodegenerative diseases such as spinal cord injury and stroke. This review article describes the different experimental approaches in OEC transplantation. We also discuss the possible effects of OEC implantation on the underlying pathophysiology in neurological disease, including neuroplasticity. Our recent study of this particular population of cells has disclosed some of the molecular basis of the regenerative mechanism of OECs. In summary OECs produce several neurotrophic factors such as stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha and brain-derived neurotrophic factor and enhance axonal regeneration to promote neuroplasticity in neurodegenerative diseases."
Preconditioning of MSCs for Acute Neurological Conditions: From Cellular to Functional Impact-A Systematic Review,"Serrenho I, Ferreira SA, Baltazar G.","AB  - This systematic review aims to gather evidence on the mechanisms triggered by diverse preconditioning strategies for mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their impact on their potential to treat ischemic and traumatic injuries affecting the nervous system. The 52 studies included in this review report nine different types of preconditioning, namely, manipulation of oxygen pressure, exposure to chemical substances, lesion mediators or inflammatory factors, usage of ultrasound, magnetic fields or biomechanical forces, and culture in scaffolds or 3D cultures. All these preconditioning strategies were reported to interfere with cellular pathways that influence MSCs' survival and migration, alter MSCs' phenotype, and modulate the secretome and proteome of these cells, among others. The effects on MSCs' phenotype and characteristics influenced MSCs' performance in models of injury, namely by increasing the homing and integration of the cells in the lesioned area and inducing the secretion of growth factors and cytokines. The administration of preconditioned MSCs promoted tissue regeneration, reduced neuroinflammation, and increased angiogenesis and myelinization in rodent models of stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury. These effects were also translated into improved cognitive and motor functions, suggesting an increased therapeutic potential of MSCs after preconditioning. Importantly, none of the studies reported adverse effects or less therapeutic potential with these strategies. Overall, we can conclude that all the preconditioning strategies included in this review can stimulate pathways that relate to the therapeutic effects of MSCs. Thus, it would be interesting to explore whether combining different preconditioning strategies can further boost the reparative effects of MSCs, solving some limitations of MSCs' therapy, namely donor-associated variability."

"Safety and Clinical Efficacy of Mesenchymal Stem Cell Treatment in Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury, Multiple Sclerosis and Ischemic Stroke - A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","Kvistad CE, Kråkenes T, Gjerde C, Mustafa K, Rekand T, Bø L.","AB  - BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is an attractive candidate in regenerative research and clinical trials have assessed their therapeutic potential in different neurological conditions with disparate etiologies. In this systematic review, we aimed to assess safety and clinical effect of MSC treatment in traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI), multiple sclerosis (MS) and ischemic stroke (IS). METHODS: A systematic search was performed 2021-12-10 in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane where clinical studies assessing MSC treatment in TSCI, MS or IS were included. Studies without control group were excluded for efficacy analysis, but included in the safety analysis. For efficacy, AIS score, EDSS score and mRS were used as clinical endpoints and assessed in a meta-analysis using the random effects model. FINDINGS: Of 5,548 identified records, 54 studies were included. Twenty-six studies assessed MSC treatment in TSCI, 14 in MS and nine in IS, of which seven, seven and five studies were controlled, respectively. There were seven serious adverse events (SAEs), of which four were related to the surgical procedure and included one death due to complications following the implantation of MSCs. Three SAEs were considered directly related to the MSC treatment and all these had a transient course. In TSCI, a meta-analysis showed no difference in conversion from AIS A to C and a trend toward more patients treated with MSCs improving from AIS A to B as compared to controls (p = 0.05). A subgroup analysis performed per protocol, showed more MSC treated patients improving from AIS A to C in studies including patients within 8 weeks after injury (p = 0.04). In MS and IS, there were no significant differences in clinical outcomes between MSC treated patients and controls as measured by EDSS and mRS, respectively. INTERPRETATION: MSC-treatment is safe in patients with TSCI, MS and IS, although surgical implantation of MSC led to one fatal outcome in TSCI. There was no clear clinical benefit of MSC treatment, but this is not necessarily a proof of inefficacy due to the low number of controlled studies. Future studies assessing efficacy of MSC treatment should aim to do this in randomized, controlled studies."
Oncostatin M: Dual Regulator of the Skeletal and Hematopoietic Systems,"Sims NA, Lévesque JP.","AB  - PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: The bone and hematopoietic tissues coemerge during development and are functionally intertwined throughout mammalian life. Oncostatin M (OSM) is an inflammatory cytokine of the interleukin-6 family produced by osteoblasts, bone marrow macrophages, and neutrophils. OSM acts via two heterodimeric receptors comprising GP130 with either an OSM receptor (OSMR) or a leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR). OSMR is expressed on osteoblasts, mesenchymal, and endothelial cells and mice deficient for the Osm or Osmr genes have both bone and blood phenotypes illustrating the importance of OSM and OSMR in regulating these two intertwined tissues. RECENT FINDINGS: OSM regulates bone mass through signaling via OSMR, adaptor protein SHC1, and transducer STAT3 to both stimulate osteoclast formation and promote osteoblast commitment; the effect on bone formation is also supported by action through LIFR. OSM produced by macrophages is an important inducer of neurogenic heterotopic ossifications in peri-articular muscles following spinal cord injury. OSM produced by neutrophils in the bone marrow induces hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell proliferation in an indirect manner via OSMR expressed by bone marrow stromal and endothelial cells that form hematopoietic stem cell niches. OSM acts as a brake to therapeutic hematopoietic stem cell mobilization in response to G-CSF and CXCR4 antagonist plerixafor. Excessive OSM production by macrophages in the bone marrow is a key contributor to poor hematopoietic stem cell mobilization (mobilopathy) in people with diabetes. OSM and OSMR may also play important roles in the progression of several cancers. It is increasingly clear that OSM plays unique roles in regulating the maintenance and regeneration of bone, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, inflammation, and skeletal muscles. Dysregulated OSM production can lead to bone pathologies, defective muscle repair and formation of heterotopic ossifications in injured muscles, suboptimal mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells, exacerbated inflammatory responses, and anti-tumoral immunity. Ongoing research will establish whether neutralizing antibodies or cytokine traps may be useful to correct pathologies associated with excessive OSM production."
In vivo tracking of stem cells in brain and spinal cord injury,"Sykova E, Jendelova P.","AB  - Cellular magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a rapidly growing field that aims to visualize and track cells in living organisms. Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles offer a sufficient signal for T2 weighted MR images. We followed the fate of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) labeled with iron oxide nanoparticles (Endorem) and human CD34+ cells labeled with magnetic MicroBeads (Miltenyi) in rats with a cortical or spinal cord lesion, models of stroke and spinal cord injury (SCI), respectively. Cells were either grafted intracerebrally, contralaterally to a cortical photochemical lesion, or injected intravenously. During the first post-transplantation week, grafted MSCs or ESCs migrated to the lesion site in the cortex as well as in the spinal cord and were visible in the lesion on MR images as a hypointensive signal, persisting for more than 30 days. In rats with an SCI, we found an increase in functional recovery after the implantation of MSCs or a freshly prepared mononuclear fraction of bone marrow cells (BMCs) or after an injection of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). Morphometric measurements in the center of the lesions showed an increase in white matter volume in cell-treated animals. Prussian blue staining confirmed a large number of iron-positive cells, and the lesions were considerably smaller than in control animals. Additionally, we implanted hydrogels based on poly-hydroxypropylmethacrylamide (HPMA) seeded with nanoparticle-labeled MSCs into hemisected rat spinal cords. Hydrogels seeded with MSCs were visible on MR images as hypointense areas, and subsequent Prussian blue histological staining confirmed positively stained cells within the hydrogels. To obtain better results with cell labeling, new polycation-bound iron oxide superparamagnetic nanoparticles (PC-SPIO) were developed. In comparison with Endorem, PC-SPIO demonstrated a more efficient intracellular uptake into MSCs, with no decrease in cell viability. Our studies demonstrate that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of grafted adult as well as ESCs labeled with iron oxide nanoparticles is a useful method for evaluating cellular migration toward a lesion site."
Why do anti-inflammatory signals of bone marrow-derived stromal cells improve neurodegenerative conditions where anti-inflammatory drugs fail?,"de Munter JPJM, Mey J, Strekalova T, Kramer BW, Wolters EC.","AB  - BACKGROUND: Although some previous studies have indicated that extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted from miRNA-modified mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may be more effective as compared with control EVs in the treatment of rats with spinal cord injuries (SCI), the efficacy of this treatment modality remains controversial. OBJECTIVES: The current study comprehensively evaluated the efficacy of different administered doses of EVs, including miRNA-overexpressing MSCs-derived EVs, among SCI rats. The efficacy of EVs' treatment was evaluated in different SCI models to provide evidence for preclinical trials. METHODS: We extensively searched the following databases to identify relevant studies: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, The Cochrane Library, and Web of Science (from inception to July 20, 2022). Two trained investigators independently screened literature, extracted the data, and evaluated literature quality. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included in this network meta-analysis. The results demonstrated that miRNA-overexpressing MSCs-derived EVs (100 and 200 μg of total protein of EVs) significantly improved hind limb motor function in rats at early stages of SCI (i.e., at 3 days after injury) as compared with EVs (100 and 200 μg of total protein of EVs, respectively). However, in the middle and late stages (14 and 28 days), there were no statistically significant differences between EVs with 200 μg dosages and miRNA-loaded EVs with 100 μg dosages. In the late stages (28 days), there were no statistically significant differences between EVs with 100 μg dosages and miRNA-loaded EVs with 200 μg dosages. We found that miRNA-overexpressing MSCs-derived EVs significantly improved motor function among early-stage SCI rats in a compression and contusion model (3 days) as compared with MSCs-derived EVs and miRNA-overexpressing MSCs-derived EVs likewise significantly improved motor function among SCI rats in a contusion model at middle and late stages (14 and 28 days). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that miRNA-overexpressing MSCs-derived EVs (200 μg of total protein of EVs) may be the best choice for the effective treatment of SCI, and miRNA-overexpressing MSCs-derived EVs may likewise be the best choice for treating contusions. However, there are some risks of bias in our included studies, and the mechanisms underlying the efficacy of EVs remain unclear.Systematic review registration: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=282051, identifier: CRD42021282051."
Efficacy of miRNA-modified mesenchymal stem cell extracellular vesicles in spinal cord injury: A systematic review of the literature and network meta-analysis,"Yang Z, Rao J, Liang Z, Xu X, Lin F, Lin Y, Wang C, Chen C.","AB  - Neurodegenerative disorders share the final degenerative pathway, the inflammation-induced apoptosis and/or necrosis, irrespective of their etiology, be it of acute and chronic traumatic, vascular and idiopathic origin. Although disease-modifying strategies are an unmet need in these disorders, lately, (pre)clinical studies suggested favorable effects after an intervention with bone marrow-derived stromal cells (bm-SC). Recent interventions with intrathecal transplantation of these cells in preclinical rodent models improved the functional outcome and reduced the inflammation, but not anti-inflammatory drugs. The benefit of bm-SCs was demonstrated in rats with an acute (traumatic spinal cord injury, tSCI) and in mice with a chronic [amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-like FUS 1-358 or SOD1-G93-A mutation] neurodegenerative process. Bm-SCs, were found to modify underlying disease processes, to reduce final clinical SCI-related outcome, and to slow down ALS-like clinical progression. After double-blind interventions with bm-SC transplantations, Vehicle (placebo), and (non)steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (Methylprednisolone, Riluzole, Celecoxib), clinical, histological and histochemical findings, serum/spinal cytokines, markers for spinal microglial activation inclusive, evidenced the cell-to-cell action of bm-SCs in both otherwise healthy and immune-deficient tSCI-rats, as well as wild-type and FUS/SOD1-transgenic ALS-like mice. The multi-pathway hypothesis of the cell-to-cell action of bmSCs, presumably using extracellular vesicles (EVs) as carriers of messages in the form of RNAs, DNA, proteins, and lipids rather than influencing a single inflammatory pathway, could be justified by the reported differences of cytokines and other chemokines in the serum and spinal tissue. The mode of action of bm-SCs is hypothesized to be associated with its dedicated adjustment of the pro-apoptotic glycogen synthase kinase-3β level towards an anti-apoptotic level whereas their multi-pathway hypothesis seems to be confirmed by the decreased levels of the pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) as well as the level of the marker of activated microglia, ionized calcium binding adapter (Iba)-1 level."
Mesenchymal Stem Cells in the Pathogenesis and Therapy of Autoimmune and Autoinflammatory Diseases,"Zaripova LN, Midgley A, Christmas SE, Beresford MW, Pain C, Baildam EM, Oldershaw RA.","AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) modulate immune responses and maintain self-tolerance. Their trophic activities and regenerative properties make them potential immunosuppressants for treating autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases. MSCs are drawn to sites of injury and inflammation where they can both reduce inflammation and contribute to tissue regeneration. An increased understanding of the role of MSCs in the development and progression of autoimmune disorders has revealed that MSCs are passive targets in the inflammatory process, becoming impaired by it and exhibiting loss of immunomodulatory activity. MSCs have been considered as potential novel cell therapies for severe autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases, which at present have only disease modifying rather than curative treatment options. MSCs are emerging as potential therapies for severe autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases. Clinical application of MSCs in rare cases of severe disease in which other existing treatment modalities have failed, have demonstrated potential use in treating multiple diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, myocardial infarction, liver cirrhosis, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and COVID-19 pneumonia. This review explores the biological mechanisms behind the role of MSCs in autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases. It also covers their immunomodulatory capabilities, potential therapeutic applications, and the challenges and risks associated with MSC therapy."
Coding and long non-coding gene expression changes in the CNS traumatic injuries,"Wu X, Wei H, Wu JQ.","AB  - Many central nervous system diseases currently lack effective treatment and are often associated with defects in microvascular function, including a failure to match the energy supplied by the blood to the energy used on neuronal computation, or a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. Pericytes, an under-studied cell type located on capillaries, are of crucial importance in regulating diverse microvascular functions, such as angiogenesis, the blood-brain barrier, capillary blood flow and the movement of immune cells into the brain.

Targeting pericytes for therapeutic approaches to neurological disorders,"Cheng J, Korte N, Nortley R, Sethi H, Tang Y, Attwell D.","AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and spinal cord injury (SCI) are two main central nervous system (CNS) traumas, caused by external physical insults. Both injuries have devastating effects on the quality of life, and there is no effective therapy at present. Notably, gene expression profiling using bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) have revealed significant changes in many coding and non-coding genes, as well as important pathways in SCI and TBI. Particularly, recent studies have revealed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) with lengths greater than 200 nucleotides and without protein-coding potential have tissue- and cell type-specific expression pattern and play critical roles in CNS injury by gain- and loss-of-function approaches. LncRNAs have been shown to regulate protein-coding genes or microRNAs (miRNAs) directly or indirectly, participating in processes including inflammation, glial activation, cell apoptosis, and vasculature events. Therefore, lncRNAs could serve as potential targets for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of SCI and TBI. In this review, we highlight the recent progress in transcriptome studies of SCI and TBI and insights into molecular mechanisms."
What is the impact of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell transplantation on clinical treatment?,"Xie Q, Liu R, Jiang J, Peng J, Yang C, Zhang W, Wang S, Song J.","AB  - BACKGROUND: Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (HUC-MSCs) present in the umbilical cord tissue are self-renewing and multipotent. They can renew themselves continuously and, under certain conditions, differentiate into one or more cell types constituting human tissues and organs. HUC-MSCs differentiate, among others, into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes and have the ability to secrete cytokines. The possibility of noninvasive harvesting and low immunogenicity of HUC-MSCs give them a unique advantage in clinical applications. In recent years, HUC-MSCs have been widely used in clinical practice, and some progress has been made in their use for therapeutic purposes. MAIN BODY: This article describes two aspects of the clinical therapeutic effects of HUC-MSCs. On the one hand, it explains the benefits and mechanisms of HUC-MSC treatment in various diseases. On the other hand, it summarizes the results of basic research on HUC-MSCs related to clinical applications. The first part of this review highlights several functions of HUC-MSCs that are critical for their therapeutic properties: differentiation into terminal cells, immune regulation, paracrine effects, anti-inflammatory effects, anti-fibrotic effects, and regulating non-coding RNA. These characteristics of HUC-MSCs are discussed in the context of diabetes and its complications, liver disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, arthritis, brain injury and cerebrovascular diseases, heart diseases, spinal cord injury, respiratory diseases, viral infections, and other diseases. The second part emphasizes the need to establish an HUC-MSC cell bank, discusses tumorigenicity of HUC-MSCs and the characteristics of different in vitro generations of these cells in the treatment of diseases, and provides technical and theoretical support for the clinical applications of HUC-MSCs. CONCLUSION: HUC-MSCs can treat a variety of diseases clinically and have achieved good therapeutic effects, and the development of HUC-MSC assistive technology has laid the foundation for its clinical application."
"Engineering Biomaterials to Influence Oligodendroglial Growth, Maturation, and Myelin Production","Russell LN, Lampe KJ.","AB  - Millions of people suffer from damage or disease to the nervous system that results in a loss of myelin, such as through a spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis. Diminished myelin levels lead to further cell death in which unmyelinated neurons die. In the central nervous system, a loss of myelin is especially detrimental because of its poor ability to regenerate. Cell therapies such as stem or precursor cell injection have been investigated as stem cells are able to grow and differentiate into the damaged cells; however, stem cell injection alone has been unsuccessful in many areas of neural regeneration. Therefore, researchers have begun exploring combined therapies with biomaterials that promote cell growth and differentiation while localizing cells in the injured area. The regrowth of myelinating oligodendrocytes from neural stem cells through a biomaterials approach may prove to be a beneficial strategy following the onset of demyelination. This article reviews recent advancements in biomaterial strategies for the differentiation of neural stem cells into oligodendrocytes, and presents new data indicating appropriate properties for oligodendrocyte precursor cell growth. In some cases, an increase in oligodendrocyte differentiation alongside neurons is further highlighted for functional improvements where the biomaterial was then tested for increased myelination both in vitro and in vivo."
"Strategies for regeneration of components of nervous system: scaffolds, cells and biomolecules","Tian L, Prabhakaran MP, Ramakrishna S.","AB  - Nerve diseases including acute injury such as peripheral nerve injury (PNI), spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic brain injury (TBI), and chronic disease like neurodegeneration disease can cause various function disorders of nervous system, such as those relating to memory and voluntary movement. These nerve diseases produce great burden for individual families and the society, for which a lot of efforts have been made. Axonal pathways represent a unidirectional and aligned architecture allowing systematic axonal development within the tissue. Following a traumatic injury, the intricate architecture suffers disruption leading to inhibition of growth and loss of guidance. Due to limited capacity of the body to regenerate axonal pathways, it is desirable to have biomimetic approach that has the capacity to graft a bridge across the lesion while providing optimal mechanical and biochemical cues for tissue regeneration. And for central nervous system injury, one more extra precondition is compulsory: creating a less inhibitory surrounding for axonal growth. Electrospinning is a cost-effective and straightforward technique to fabricate extracellular matrix (ECM)-like nanofibrous structures, with various fibrous forms such as random fibers, aligned fibers, 3D fibrous scaffold and core-shell fibers from a variety of polymers. The diversity and versatility of electrospinning technique, together with functionalizing cues such as neurotrophins, ECM-based proteins and conductive polymers, have gained considerable success for the nerve tissue applications. We are convinced that in the future the stem cell therapy with the support of functionalized electrospun nerve scaffolds could be a promising therapy to cure nerve diseases."

They are usually difficult to treat with standard medical therapy and often they recur. In the search for better treatment options, promising alternative forms of treatment are today emerging. Within the field of regenerative medicine, ongoing research on advanced therapies seeks to develop medicinal products based on gene therapy, somatic cell therapy, tissue-engineering and combinations of these. OBJECTIVE: The main objective is to perform an overview of experimental and clinical developments in somatic cell therapy and tissue engineering targeting the treatment of pressure injuries.

Bone marrow stem cells and polymer hydrogels--two strategies for spinal cord injury repair,"Syková E, Jendelová P, Urdzíková L, Lesný P, Hejcl A.","AB  - OBJECTIVES: A remarkable increase in traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) morbidity has occurred in China from 2001 to 2010 due to rapid industrial and economic development; this increase seriously threatens public health. The current study investigated the major causes and severity of TSCI in 561 hospitalized TSCI patients who came from all over China to the General Hospital of Chinese People's Armed Police Forces. METHODS: Information (including each patient's age, gender, time and cause of injury and severity of spinal cord injury (SCI, complete or incomplete)) regarding 561 hospitalized TSCI patients whose injuries occurred between 2001 and 2010 was retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 561 patients, the youngest was 9 months old and the oldest was 67 years old; the average patient age was 34.74 ± 12.24 years. The sex ratio was 4.1:1 (male:female). The injuries were primarily caused by transportation accidents (51.2%), falling from a height (23.9%), tamping (8.6%), stumbling (8.0%), stabbing (3.0%) and crushing (1.8%). Although no statistically significant associations were observed between the different injury causes and severity of the injury, a statistically significant association was observed between the different injury causes and levels of the lesion. CONCLUSION: Transportation accidents, falling from a height, tamping, stumbling, stabbing and crushing are the most common causes of TSCI. No statistically significant relationships were observed between certain injury causes and either complete or incomplete injury. However, different injury causes usually led to different levels of the lesion. No statistical differences were observed between the levels of the lesion and either complete or incomplete injury."
Analysis of the causes and types of traumatic spinal cord injury based on 561 cases in China from 2001 to 2010,"Hua R, Shi J, Wang X, Yang J, Zheng P, Cheng H, Li M, Dai G, An Y.","AB  - 1. Emerging clinical studies of treating brain and spinal cord injury (SCI) led us to examine the effect of autologous adult stem cell transplantation as well as the use of polymer scaffolds in spinal cord regeneration. We compared an intravenous injection of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or the injection of a freshly prepared mononuclear fraction of bone marrow cells (BMCs) on the treatment of an acute or chronic balloon-induced spinal cord compression lesion in rats. Based on our experimental studies, autologous BMC implantation has been used in a Phase I/II clinical trial in patients (n=20) with a transversal spinal cord lesion. 2. MSCs were isolated from rat bone marrow by their adherence to plastic, labeled with iron-oxide nanoparticles and expanded in vitro. Macroporous hydrogels based on derivatives of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) or 2-hydroxypropyl methacrylamide (HPMA) were prepared, then modified by their copolymerization with a hydrolytically degradable crosslinker, N,O-dimethacryloylhydroxylamine, or by different surface electric charges. Hydrogels or hydrogels seeded with MSCs were implanted into rats with hemisected spinal cords. 3. Lesioned animals grafted with MSCs or BMCs had smaller lesions 35 days postgrafting and higher scores in BBB testing than did control animals and also showed a faster recovery of sensitivity in their hind limbs using the plantar test. The functional improvement was more pronounced in MSC-treated rats. In MR images, the lesion populated by grafted cells appeared as a dark hypointense area and was considerably smaller than in control animals. Morphometric measurements showed an increase in the volume of spared white matter in cell-treated animals. In the clinical trial, we compared intraarterial (via a. vertebralis, n=6) versus intravenous administration of BMCs (n=14) in a group of subacute (10-33 days post-SCI, n=8) and chronic patients (2-18 months, n=12). For patient follow-up we used MEP, SEP, MRI, and the ASIA score. Our clinical study revealed that the implantation of BMCs into patients is safe, as there were no complications following cell administration. Partial improvement in the ASIA score and partial recovery of MEP or SEP have been observed in all subacute patients who received cells via a. vertebralis (n=4) and in one out of four subacute patients who received cells intravenously. Improvement was also found in one chronic patient who received cells via a. vertebralis. A much larger population of patients is needed before any conclusions can be drawn. The implantation of hydrogels into hemisected rat spinal cords showed that cellular ingrowth was most pronounced in copolymers of HEMA with a positive surface electric charge. Although most of the cells had the morphological properties of connective tissue elements, we found NF-160-positive axons invading all the implanted hydrogels from both the proximal and distal stumps. The biodegradable hydrogels degraded from the border that was in direct contact with the spinal cord tissue. They were resorbed by macrophages and replaced by newly formed tissue containing connective tissue elements, blood vessels, GFAP-positive astrocytic processes, and NF-160-positive neurofilaments. Additionally, we implanted hydrogels seeded with nanoparticle-labeled MSCs into hemisected rat spinal cords. Hydrogels seeded with MSCs were visible on MR images as hypointense areas, and subsequent Prussian blue histological staining confirmed positively stained cells within the hydrogels. 4. We conclude that treatment with different bone marrow cell populations had a positive effect on behavioral outcome and histopathological assessment after SCI in rats; this positive effect was most pronounced following MSC treatment. Our clinical study suggests a possible positive effect in patients with SCI. Bridging the lesion cavity can be an approach for further improving regeneration. Our preclinical studies showed that macroporous polymer hydrogels based on derivatives of HEMA or HPMA are suitable materials for bridging cavities after SCI; their chemical and physical properties can be modified to a specific use, and 3D implants seeded with different cell types may facilitate the ingrowth of axons."
Olfactory ensheathing cells from the nose: clinical application in human spinal cord injuries,"Mackay-Sim A, St John JA.","AB  - Olfactory mucosa, the sense organ of smell, is an adult tissue that is regenerated and repaired throughout life to maintain the integrity of the sense of smell. When the sensory neurons of the olfactory epithelium die they are replaced by proliferation of stem cells and their axons grow from the nose to brain assisted by olfactory ensheathing cells located in the lamina propria beneath the sensory epithelium. When transplanted into the site of traumatic spinal cord injury in rat, olfactory lamina propria or purified olfactory ensheathing cells promote behavioural recovery and assist regrowth of some nerves in the spinal cord. A Phase I clinical trial demonstrated that autologous olfactory ensheathing cell transplantation is safe, with no adverse outcomes recorded for three years following transplantation. Autologous olfactory mucosa transplantation is also being investigated in traumatic spinal cord injury although this whole tissue contains many cells in addition to olfactory ensheathing cells, including stem cells. If olfactory ensheathing cells are proven therapeutic for human spinal cord injury there are several important practical issues that will need to be solved before they reach general clinical application. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Understanding olfactory ensheathing glia and their prospect for nervous system repair."
Challenges in advancing Schwann cell transplantation for spinal cord injury repair,"Guest JD, Santamaria AJ, Solano JP, de Rivero Vaccari JP, Dietrich WD, Pearse DD, Khan A, Levi AD.","AB  - BACKGROUND AIMS: In this article we aimed to provide an expert synthesis of the current status of Schwann cell (SC)therapeutics and potential steps to increase their clinical utility. METHODS: We provide an expert synthesis based on preclinical, clinical and manufacturing experience. RESULTS: Schwann cells (SCs) are essential for peripheral nerve regeneration and are of interest in supporting axonal repair after spinal cord injury (SCI). SCs can be isolated and cultivated in tissue culture from adult nerve biopsies or generated from precursors and neural progenitors using specific differentiation protocols leading to expanded quantities. In culture, they undergo dedifferentiation to a state similar to repair"" SCs. The known repertoire of SC functions is increasing beyond axon maintenance"
Combination of Drugs and Cell Transplantation: More Beneficial Stem Cell-Based Regenerative Therapies Targeting Neurological Disorders,"Nishimura K, Takata K.","AB  - Long regarded as impossible, spinal cord repair is approaching the realm of reality as efforts to bridge the gap between bench and bedside point to novel approaches to treatment. It is important to recognize that the research playing field is rapidly changing and that new mechanisms of resource development are required to effectively make the transition from basic science discoveries to effective clinical treatments. This article reviews recent laboratory studies and phase 1 clinical trials in neural and nonneural cell transplantation, stressing that the transition from basic science to clinical applications requires a parallel rather than serial approach, with continuous, two-way feedback to most efficiently translate basic science findings, through evaluation and optimization, to clinical treatments. An example of mobilizing endogenous stem cells for repair is reviewed, with emphasis on the rapid application of basic science to clinical therapy. Successful and efficient transition from basic science to clinical applications requires (1) a parallel rather than a serial approach; (2) development of centers that integrate three spheres of science, translational, transitional, and clinical trials; and (3) development of novel resources to fund the most critically limited step of transitional to clinical trials."
Spinal cord injury: promising interventions and realistic goals,"McDonald JW, Becker D.","AB  - Cell transplantation therapy using pluripotent/multipotent stem cells has gained attention as a novel therapeutic strategy for treating neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, ischemic stroke, and spinal cord injury. To fully realize the potential of cell transplantation therapy, new therapeutic options that increase cell engraftments must be developed, either through modifications to the grafted cells themselves or through changes in the microenvironment surrounding the grafted region. Together these developments could potentially restore lost neuronal function by better supporting grafted cells. In addition, drug administration can improve the outcome of cell transplantation therapy through better accessibility and delivery to the target region following cell transplantation. Here we introduce examples of drug repurposing approaches for more successful transplantation therapies based on preclinical experiments with clinically approved drugs. Drug repurposing is an advantageous drug development strategy because drugs that have already been clinically approved can be repurposed to treat other diseases faster and at lower cost. Therefore, drug repurposing is a reasonable approach to enhance the outcomes of cell transplantation therapies for neurological diseases. Ideal repurposing candidates would result in more efficient cell transplantation therapies and provide a new and beneficial therapeutic combination."
The developing human spinal cord contains distinct populations of neural precursors,"Ferretti P, Mackay M, Walder S.","AB  - Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) offer a new and remarkable potential for treating and curing a wide range of genetic diseases such as diabetes and muscular dystrophy, degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, renal disease and heart disease, and traumatic injury such as spinal cord injury. Therapeutic cloning, wherein patient-specific ESCs can be derived from pre-implantation stage embryos produced by somatic cell nuclear transfer, constitutes one approach of obtaining histocompatible cells for engraftment. Recent improvements in the production of cloned embryos in non-human primate models, combined with advances in the ability to establish human ESC lines and direct their differentiation along specific pathways support the notion that therapeutic cloning may soon be feasible. This review summarizes the status and current feasibility of the approach and the technical hurdles that must be addressed, and discusses the ethical issues that have arisen as a result."
Therapeutic cloning: status and prospects,"Han Z, Vandevoort CA, Latham KE.","AB  - It is becoming apparent that neural stem cells display some differences in their behaviour depending on the region of the CNS they originate from and on whether they are derived from embryonic or adult tissue. Whereas much work has focused on brain neural stem cells, less attention has been paid to spinal cord neural precursors, particularly in the developing human embryo. We briefly review here some of our work which points at some similarities between neural precursors in developing human spinal cords and in animals which can regenerate their spinal cord (e.g. tailed amphibians), and at differences in the properties of human neural precursors with spinal cord development. Altogether these studies suggest the existence of dynamic neural stem cell populations within the developing spinal cord. They also support the notion that thorough characterization of neural stem cells under different culture conditions and analysis of how these may affect their differentiation in vivo after grafting into different injury models is imperative if we are to develop effective cell therapy strategies for spinal cord injury and diseases."
Application of human mesenchymal and pluripotent stem cell microcarrier cultures in cellular therapy: achievements and future direction,"Chen AK, Reuveny S, Oh SK.","AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have recently made significant progress with multiple clinical trials targeting modulation of immune responses, regeneration of bone, cartilage, myocardia, and diseases like Metachromatic leukodystrophy and Hurler syndrome. On the other hand, the use of human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in clinical trials is rather limited mainly due to safety issues. Only two clinical trials, retinal pigment epithelial transplantation and treatment of spinal cord injury were reported. Cell doses per treatment can range between 50,000 and 6 billion cells. The current 2-dimensional tissue culture platform can be used when low cell doses are needed and it becomes impractical when doses above 50 million are needed. This demand for future cell therapy has reinvigorated interests in the use of the microcarrier platform for generating stem cells in a scalable 3-dimensional manner. Microcarriers developed for culturing adherent cell lines in suspension have been used mainly in vaccine production and research purposes. Since MSCs grow as monolayers similar to conventional adherent cell lines, adapting MSCs to a microcarrier based expansion platform has been progressing rapidly. On the other hand, establishing a robust microcarrier platform for hPSCs is more challenging as these cells grow in multilayer colonies on extracellular matrices and are more susceptible to shear stress. This review describes properties of commercially available microcarriers developed for cultivation of anchorage dependent cells and present current achievements for expansion and differentiation of stem cells. Key issues such as microcarrier properties and coatings, cell seeding conditions, medium development and improved bioprocess parameters needed for optimal stem cell systems are discussed."
Adult mesenchymal stem cells for tissue engineering versus regenerative medicine,Caplan AI.,"AB  - Adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be isolated from bone marrow or marrow aspirates and because they are culture-dish adherent, they can be expanded in culture while maintaining their multipotency. The MSCs have been used in preclinical models for tissue engineering of bone, cartilage, muscle, marrow stroma, tendon, fat, and other connective tissues. These tissue-engineered materials show considerable promise for use in rebuilding damaged or diseased mesenchymal tissues. Unanticipated is the realization that the MSCs secrete a large spectrum of bioactive molecules. These molecules are immunosuppressive, especially for T-cells and, thus, allogeneic MSCs can be considered for therapeutic use. In this context, the secreted bioactive molecules provide a regenerative microenvironment for a variety of injured adult tissues to limit the area of damage and to mount a self-regulated regenerative response. This regenerative microenvironment is referred to as trophic activity and, therefore, MSCs appear to be valuable mediators for tissue repair and regeneration. The natural titers of MSCs that are drawn to sites of tissue injury can be augmented by allogeneic MSCs delivered via the bloodstream. Indeed, human clinical trials are now under way to use allogeneic MSCs for treatment of myocardial infarcts, graft-versus-host disease, Crohn's Disease, cartilage and meniscus repair, stroke, and spinal cord injury. This review summarizes the biological basis for the in vivo functioning of MSCs through development and aging."
Tau Pathology Triggered by Spinal Cord Injury Can Play a Critical Role in the Neurotrauma Development,"Nakhjiri E, Vafaee MS, Hojjati SMM, Shahabi P, Shahpasand K.","AB  - Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) can result in substantial neurological impairment along with significant emotional and psychological distress. It is clear that there is profound neurodegeneration upon SCI, gradually spread to other spinal cord regions and brain areas. Despite extensive considerations, it remains uncertain how pathogenicity diffuses in the cord. It has been reported that tau protein abnormal hyperphosphorylation plays a central role in neurodegeneration triggered by traumatic brain injury (TBI). Tau is a microtubule-associated protein, heavily implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Importantly, tau pathology spreads in a traumatic brain in a timely manner. In particular, we have recently demonstrated that phosphorylated tau at Thr231 exists in two distinct cis and trans conformations, in which that cis P-tau is extremely neurotoxic, has a prion nature, and spreads to various brain areas and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) upon trauma. On the other hand, tau pathology, in particular hyperphosphorylation at Thr231, has been observed upon SCI. Taken these together, we conclude that cis pT231-tau may accumulate and spread in the spinal cord as well as CSF and diffuse tau pathology in the central nervous system (CNS). Moreover, antibody against cis P-tau can target intracellular cis P-tau and protect pathology spreading. Thus, considering cis P-tau as a driver of tau pathology and neurodegeneration upon SCI would open new windows toward understanding the disease development and early biomarkers. Furthermore, it would help us develop effective therapies for SCI patients."
The design criteria and therapeutic strategy of functional scaffolds for spinal cord injury repair,"Cao J, Wu J, Mu J, Feng S, Gao J.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) remains a therapeutic challenge in clinic. Current drug and cell therapeutics have obtained significant efficacy but are still in the early stages for complete neural and functional recovery. In the past few decades, functional scaffolds (FSs) have been rapidly developed to bridge the lesion and provide a framework for tissue regeneration in SCI repair. Moreover, a FS can act as an adjuvant for locally delivering drugs in the lesion with a designed drug release profile, and supplying a biomimetic environment for implanted cells. In this review, the design criteria of FSs for SCI treatment are summarized according to their biocompatibility, mechanical properties, morphology, architecture, and biodegradability. Subsequently, FSs designed for SCI repair in the scope of drug delivery, cell implantation and combination therapy are introduced, respectively. And how a FS promotes their therapeutic efficacy is analyzed. Finally, the challenges, perspectives, and potential of FSs for SCI treatment are discussed. Hopefully, this review may inspire the future development of potent FSs to facilitate SCI repair in clinic."
Equine Musculoskeletal Pathologies: Clinical Approaches and Therapeutical Perspectives-A Review,"Reis IL, Lopes B, Sousa P, Sousa AC, Caseiro AR, Mendonça CM, Santos JM, Atayde LM, Alvites RD, Maurício AC.","AB  - Musculoskeletal injuries such as equine osteoarthritis, osteoarticular defects, tendonitis/desmitis, and muscular disorders are prevalent among sport horses, with a fair prognosis for returning to exercise or previous performance levels. The field of equine medicine has witnessed rapid and fruitful development, resulting in a diverse range of therapeutic options for musculoskeletal problems. Staying abreast of these advancements can be challenging, prompting the need for a comprehensive review of commonly used and recent treatments. The aim is to compile current therapeutic options for managing these injuries, spanning from simple to complex physiotherapy techniques, conservative treatments including steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hyaluronic acid, polysulfated glycosaminoglycans, pentosan polysulfate, and polyacrylamides, to promising regenerative therapies such as hemoderivatives and stem cell-based therapies. Each therapeutic modality is scrutinized for its benefits, limitations, and potential synergistic actions to facilitate their most effective application for the intended healing/regeneration of the injured tissue/organ and subsequent patient recovery. While stem cell-based therapies have emerged as particularly promising for equine musculoskeletal injuries, a multidisciplinary approach is underscored throughout the discussion, emphasizing the importance of considering various therapeutic modalities in tandem."
Mechanically Activated Adipose Tissue as a Source for Novel Therapies in Neurological Disease/Injury,"Gorio A, Gao H, Klinger M, Vinci V, Paino F.","AB  - In this review, we describe a new avenue that involves the therapeutic use of human adipose tissue. In the past two decades, thousands of papers have described the potential clinical use of human fat and adipose tissue. Moreover, mesenchymal stem cells have been a source of great enthusiasm in clinical studies, and these have generated curiosity at academic levels. On the other hand, they have created considerable commercial business opportunities. High expectations have emerged for curing some recalcitrant diseases or reconstructing anatomically defective human body parts, but several concerns have been raised by generating criticism on the clinical practice that have not been substantiated by rigorous scientific evidence. However, in general, the consensus is that human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines and stimulate the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Here, we show that the application of a mechanical elliptical force for several minutes to human abdominal fat activates anti-inflammatory properties and gene-related expression. This may pave the way for new unexpected clinical developments."
An Overview of Mesenchymal Stem Cell-based Therapy Mediated by Noncoding RNAs in the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Luo Y, Qiu W, Wu B, Fang F.","AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have become a promising tool for neurorestorative therapy of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), which are mainly characterized by the progressive and irreversible loss of neuronal structure and function in the central or peripheral nervous system. Recently, studies have reported that genetic manipulation mediated by noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) can increase survival and neural regeneration of transplanted MSCs, offering a new strategy for clinical translation. In this review, we summarize the potential role and regulatory mechanism of two major types of ncRNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), during the neurogenesis of MSCs with gene expression profile analyses. We also overview the realization of MSC-based therapy mediated by ncRNAs in the treatment of spinal cord injury, stroke, Alzheimer's disease and peripheral nerve injury. It is expected that ncRNAs will become promising therapeutic targets for NDD on stem cells, while the underlying mechanisms require further exploration."
Bioactive 2D nanomaterials for neural repair and regeneration,"He X, Zhu Y, Ma B, Xu X, Huang R, Cheng L, Zhu R.","AB  - Biomaterials have provided promising strategies towards improving the functions of injured tissues of the nervous system. Recently, 2D nanomaterials, such as graphene, layered double hydroxides (LDHs), and black phosphorous, which are characterized by ultrathin film structures, have attracted much attention in the fields of neural repair and regeneration. 2D nanomaterials have extraordinary physicochemical properties and excellent biological activities, such as a large surface-area-to-thickness ratio, high levels of adhesion, and adjustable flexibility. In addition, they can be designed to have superior biocompatibility and electrical or nano-carrier properties. To date, many 2D nanomaterials have been used for synaptic modulation, neuroinflammatory reduction, stem cell fate regulation, and injured neural cell/tissue repair. In this review, we discuss the advances in 2D nanomaterial technology towards novel neurological applications and the mechanisms underlying their unique features. In addition, the future outlook of functional 2D nanomaterials towards addressing the difficult issues of neuropathy has been explored to introduce a promising strategy towards repairing and regenerating the injured nervous system."
Movement rehabilitation after spinal cord injuries: emerging concepts and future directions,"Marsh BC, Astill SL, Utley A, Ichiyama RM.","AB  - Considerable inroads are being made into developing new treatments for spinal cord injury (SCI) which aim to facilitate functional recovery, including locomotion. Research on rehabilitative strategies following SCI using animal models has demonstrated that regaining and maintaining motor function, such as standing or stepping, is governed by principles of skill acquisition. Mechanisms key to learning motor tasks, including retention and transfer of skill, feedback and conditions of practice, all have examples in the SCI animal literature, although the importance of many concepts may often be overlooked. Combinatorial strategies which include physical rehabilitation are beginning to yield promising results. However, the effects of molecular-cellular interventions including chondroitinaseABC, anti-NogoA, foetal stem cell transplantation, etc., are still poorly understood with reference to the changes made to spinal plasticity by training and exercise. Studies that investigate the interplay between rehabilitation and other treatments have had mixed results; it appears likely that precise timings of different interventions will help to maximize recovery of function. Understanding how the time-course of injury and different rehabilitative and treatment modalities might factor into spinal plasticity will be critical in future therapeutic interventions."
[Role of IL-6 in regulation of inflammation and stem cell differentiation in CNS trauma],"Mukaino M, Nakamura M, Okada S, Toyama Y, Liu M, Okano H.","AB  - Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in CNS trauma as a proinflammatory cytokine which regulates inflammatory response. Not only being a mediator of inflammation, but IL-6 induces neural stem/progenitor cells to undergo astrocytic differentiation selectively in the injured CNS. These effects are considered to coordinate to prevent the CNS repair after traumatic injury. Consistently, we previously reported that the administration of anti-IL-6 receptor antibody (MR16-1) immediately after spinal cord injury in mice decreased the number of invading inflammatory cells and the severity of connective tissue scar formation, and led to improved functional recovery. These findings suggest that neutralization of IL-6 signaling in the acute phase of SCI will be beneficial for CNS repair. A critical merit of this anti-IL-6 receptor antibody is that humanized antibody to human IL-6 receptor (MRA; Atlizumab) has already been reshaped. However, there are several studies which show beneficial aspects of IL-6 signaling in the pathology of CNS trauma. Further investigation of the mechanisms how MR16-1 reduces tissue damage should be required for clinical application."
Potential of dental pulp stem cells and their products in promoting peripheral nerve regeneration and their future applications,"Xing WB, Wu ST, Wang XX, Li FY, Wang RX, He JH, Fu J, He Y.","AB  - Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) seriously affects people's quality of life. Stem cell therapy is considered a promising new option for the clinical treatment of PNI. Dental stem cells, particularly dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), are adult pluripotent stem cells derived from the neuroectoderm. DPSCs have significant potential in the field of neural tissue engineering due to their numerous advantages, such as easy isolation, multidifferentiation potential, low immunogenicity, and low transplant rejection rate. DPSCs are extensively used in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, including for the treatment of sciatic nerve injury, facial nerve injury, spinal cord injury, and other neurodegenerative diseases. This article reviews research related to DPSCs and their advantages in treating PNI, aiming to summarize the therapeutic potential of DPSCs for PNI and the underlying mechanisms and providing valuable guidance and a foundation for future research."
Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor and Its Applications through Nanosystem Delivery,"Xia M, Zhao T, Wang X, Li Y, Li Y, Zheng T, Li J, Feng Y, Wei Y, Sun P.","AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a protein that performs a neurotrophic function. BDNF and its receptors are widely expressed in the nervous system and can promote the growth of neurons and the formation of neuronal synapses in the brain. Studies have shown that a lack of BDNF can lead to impairment of memory and cognitive functions, indicating that BDNF plays an important role in mental illness and neurodegenerative diseases. The combination of stem cells and BDNF-releasing nanomaterials holds great promise in regenerative medicine, especially in the treatment of neurological diseases. For example, Alzheimer's disease, depression, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury, etc. The combination of stem cell/pharmacologically active carrier and BDNF-nano/hydrogel provided a useful new type of local delivery tool for the treatment of the nervous system and other diseases. It can not only provide BDNF but also stem cells. These studies will provide a scientific basis for the development and application of BDNF in the future."
Money and morals: ending clinical trials for financial reasons,"Eaton ML, Kwon BK, Scott CT.","AB  - Too often, biopharmaceutical companies stop their clinical trials solely for financial reasons. In this chapter, we discuss this phenomenon against the backdrop of a 2011 decision by Geron Corporation to abandon its stem cell clinical trial for spinal cord injury (SCI), the preliminary results of which were released in May 2014. We argue that the resultant harms are widespread and are different in nature from the consequences of stopping trials for scientific or medical reasons. We examine the ethical and social effects that arise from such decisions and discuss them in light of ethical frameworks, including duties of individual stakeholders and corporate sponsors. We offer ways that sponsors and clinical sites can ensure that trials are responsibly started, and once started adequately protect the interests of participants. We conclude with recommendations that industry sponsors of clinical trials should adopt in order to advance a collective and patient-centered research ethic."
Role of NLRP3 Inflammasome in Post-Spinal-Cord-Injury Anxiety and Depression: Molecular Mechanisms and Therapeutic Implications,"Mokhtari T, Uludag K.","AB  - The majority of research on the long-term effects of spinal cord injury (SCI) has primarily focused on neuropathic pain (NP), psychological issues, and sensorimotor impairments. Among SCI patients, mood disorders, such as anxiety and depression, have been extensively studied. It has been found that chronic stress and NP have negative consequences and reduce the quality of life for individuals living with SCI. Our review examined both human and experimental evidence to explore the connection between mood changes following SCI and inflammatory pathways, with a specific focus on NLRP3 inflammasome signaling. We observed increased proinflammatory factors in the blood, as well as in the brain and spinal cord tissues of SCI models. The NLRP3 inflammasome plays a crucial role in various diseases by controlling the release of proinflammatory molecules like interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and IL-18. Dysregulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in key brain regions associated with pain processing, such as the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, contributes to the development of mood disorders following SCI. In this review, we summarized recent research on the expression and regulation of components related to NLRP3 inflammasome signaling in mood disorders following SCI. Finally, we discussed potential therapeutic approaches that target the NLRP3 inflammasome and regulate proinflammatory cytokines as a way to treat mood disorders following SCI."
Epigenetic marks or not? The discovery of novel DNA modifications in eukaryotes,"Meng WY, Wang ZX, Zhang Y, Hou Y, Xue JH.","AB  - DNA modifications add another layer of complexity to the eukaryotic genome to regulate gene expression, playing critical roles as epigenetic marks. In eukaryotes, the study of DNA epigenetic modifications has been confined to 5mC and its derivatives for decades. However, rapid developing approaches have witnessed the expansion of DNA modification reservoirs during the past several years, including the identification of 6mA, 5gmC, 4mC, and 4acC in diverse organisms. However, whether these DNA modifications function as epigenetic marks requires careful consideration. In this review, we try to present a panorama of all the DNA epigenetic modifications in eukaryotes, emphasizing recent breakthroughs in the identification of novel DNA modifications. The characterization of their roles in transcriptional regulation as potential epigenetic marks is summarized. More importantly, the pathways for generating or eliminating these DNA modifications, as well as the proteins involved are comprehensively dissected. Furthermore, we briefly discuss the potential challenges and perspectives, which should be taken into account while investigating novel DNA modifications."
Human umbilical cord blood cells or estrogen may be beneficial in treating heatstroke,"Chen SH, Huang KF, Lin MT, Chang FM.","AB  - This current review summarized animal models of heatstroke experimentation that promote our current knowledge of therapeutic effects on cerebrovascular dysfunction, coagulopathy, and/or systemic inflammation with human umbilical cord blood cells (HUCBCs) or estrogen in the setting of heatstroke. Accumulating evidences have demonstrated that HUCBCs provide a promising new therapeutic method against neurodegenerative diseases, such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury as well as blood disease. More recently, we have also demonstrated that post- or pretreatment by HUCBCs may resuscitate heatstroke rats with by reducing circulatory shock, and cerebral nitric oxide overload and ischemic injury. Moreover, CD34+ cells sorted from HUCBCs may improve survival by attenuating inflammatory, coagulopathy, and multiorgan dysfunction during experimental heatstroke. Many researchers indicated pro- (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha]) and anti-inflammatory (e.g. interleukin-10 [IL-10]) cytokines in the peripheral blood stream correlate with severity of circulatory shock, cerebral ischemia and hypoxia, and neuronal damage occurring in heatstroke. It has been shown that intravenous administration of CD34+ cells can secrete therapeutic molecules, such as neurotrophic factors, and attenuate systemic inflammatory reactions by decreasing serum TNF-alpha but increasing IL-10 during heatstroke. Another line of evidence has suggested that estrogen influences the severity of injury associated with cerebrovascular shock. Recently, we also successfully demonstrated estrogen resuscitated heatstroke rats by ameliorating systemic inflammation. Conclusively, HUCBCs or estrogen may be employed as a beneficial therapeutic strategy in prevention and repair of cerebrovascular dysfunction, coagulopathy, and/or systemic inflammation during heatstroke."
Efficacy of adipose tissue-derived stem cells in locomotion recovery after spinal cord injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis on animal studies,"Rafiei Alavi SN, Madani Neishaboori A, Hossein H, Sarveazad A, Yousefifard M.","AB  - BACKGROUND: Considerable disparities exist on the use of adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) for treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI). Hence, the current systematic review aimed to investigate the efficacy of ADSCs in locomotion recovery following SCI in animal models. METHODS: A search was conducted in electronic databases of MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science until the end of July 2019. Reference and citation tracking and searching Google and Google Scholar search engines were performed to achieve more studies. Animal studies conducted on rats having SCI which were treated with ADSCs were included in the study. Exclusion criteria were lacking a non-treated control group, not evaluating locomotion, non-rat studies, not reporting the number of transplanted cells, not reporting isolation and preparation methods of stem cells, review articles, combination therapy, use of genetically modified ADSCs, use of induced pluripotent ADSCs, and human trials. Risk of bias was assessed using Hasannejad et al.'s proposed method for quality control of SCI-animal studies. Data were analyzed in STATA 14.0 software, and based on a random effect model, pooled standardized mean difference with a 95% confidence interval was presented. RESULTS: Of 588 non-duplicated papers, data from 18 articles were included. Overall risk of bias was high risk in 8 studies, some concern in 9 studies and low risk in 1 study. Current evidence demonstrated that ADSCs transplantation could improve locomotion following SCI (standardized mean difference = 1.71; 95%CI 1.29-2.13; p < 0.0001). A considerable heterogeneity was observed between the studies (I(2) = 72.0%; p < 0.0001). Subgroup analysis and meta-regression revealed that most of the factors like injury model, the severity of SCI, treatment phase, injury location, and number of transplanted cells did not have a significant effect on the efficacy of ADSCs in improving locomotion following SCI (p(for odds ratios) > 0.05). CONCLUSION: We conclude that any number of ADSCs by any prescription routes can improve locomotion recovery in an SCI animal model, at any phase of SCI, with any severity. Given the remarkable bias about blinding, clinical translation of the present results is tough, because in addition to the complexity of the nervous system and the involvement of far more complex motor circuits in the human, blinding compliance and motor outcome assessment tests in animal studies and clinical trials are significantly different."
Stem cell repair of central nervous system injury,"Cao Q, Benton RL, Whittemore SR.","AB  - Neural stem cells (NSCs) have great potential as a therapeutic tool for the repair of a number of CNS disorders. NSCs can either be isolated from embryonic and adult brain tissue or be induced from both mouse and human ES cells. These cells proliferate in vitro through many passages without losing their multipotentiality. Following engraftment into the adult CNS, NSCs differentiate mainly into glia, except in neurogenic areas. After engraftment into the injured and diseased CNS, their differentiation is further retarded. In vitro manipulation of NSC fate prior to transplantation and/or modification of the host environment may be necessary to control the terminal lineage of the transplanted cells to obtain functionally significant numbers of neurons. NSCs and a few types of glial precursors have shown the capability to differentiate into oligodendrocytes and to remyeliate the demyelinated axons in the CNS, but the functional extent of remyelination achieved by these transplants is limited. Manipulation of endogenous neural precursors may be an alternative therapy or a complimentary therapy to stem cell transplantation for neurodegenerative disease and CNS injury. However, this at present is challenging and so far has been unsuccessful. Understanding mechanisms of NSC differentiation in the context of the injured CNS will be critical to achieving these therapeutic strategies."
Neuroprotective features of mesenchymal stem cells,"Uccelli A, Benvenuto F, Laroni A, Giunti D.","AB  - Bone marrow (BM) derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) differentiate into cells of the mesodermal lineage but also, under certain experimental circumstances, into cells of the neuronal and glial lineage. Their therapeutic translation has been significantly boosted by the demonstration that MSC display significant also anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic features. These properties have been exploited in the effective treatment of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis where the inhibition of the autoimmune response resulted in a significant neuroprotection. A significant rescue of neural cells has been achieved also when MSC were administered in experimental brain ischemia and in animals undergoing brain or spinal cord injury. In these experimental conditions BM-MSC therapeutic effects are likely to depend on paracrine mechanisms mediated by the release of growth factors, anti-apoptotic molecules and anti-inflammatory cytokines creating a favorable environment for the regeneration of neurons, remyelination and improvement of cerebral flow. For potential clinical application BM-MSC offer significant practical advantages over other types of stem cells since they can be obtained from the adult BM and can be easily cultured and expanded in vitro under GMP conditions displaying a very low risk of malignant transformation. This review discusses the targets and mechanisms of BM-MSC mediated neuroprotection."
Mesenchymal stem cell secretome and extracellular vesicles for neurodegenerative diseases: Risk-benefit profile and next steps for the market access,"Giovannelli L, Bari E, Jommi C, Tartara F, Armocida D, Garbossa D, Cofano F, Torre ML, Segale L.","AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases represent a growing burden on healthcare systems worldwide. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have shown promise as a potential therapy due to their neuroregenerative, neuroprotective, and immunomodulatory properties, which are, however, linked to the bioactive substances they release, collectively known as secretome. This paper provides an overview of the most recent research on the safety and efficacy of MSC-derived secretome and extracellular vesicles (EVs) in clinical (if available) and preclinical models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease, acute ischemic stroke, and spinal cord injury. The article explores the biologically active substances within MSC-secretome/EVs, the mechanisms responsible for the observed therapeutic effects, and the strategies that may be used to optimize MSC-secretome/EVs production based on specific therapeutic needs. The review concludes with a critical discussion of current clinical trials and a perspective on potential future directions in translating MSC-secretome and EVs into the clinic, specifically regarding how to address the challenges associated with their pharmaceutical manufacturing, including scalability, batch-to-batch consistency, adherence to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) guidelines, formulation, and storage, along with quality controls, access to the market and relative costs, value for money and impact on total expenditure."
Restoring motor function using optogenetics and neural engraftment,"Bryson JB, Machado CB, Lieberam I, Greensmith L.","AB  - Spinal cord injury often results in irreversible and permanent neurologic deficits below the lesion level. Nowadays, treatment is limited to drugs and/or physiotherapy aimed at compensating disability. New experimental studies focus on the transplantation of cells capable of surviving, regenerating tissue, recovering functions and/or improving symptoms. A review of such type of studies on spinal cord reconstruction published between 1991 and 2004 is presented. In the latter years, cell transplantation appeared as the most promising approach in spinal cord regeneration research. To date, this promise has not been maintained, despite the appearance of new attractive cell populations for grafting, such as neural stem cells. The demonstration that stem cells exist in the adult brain and that they can be isolated and expanded in vitro offers the possibility to test such interesting cells in the paraplegic rat. Some neurotrophic factors can facilitate axonal regeneration and neuronal survival. Therefore, the development of strategies, such as implanting neural stem cells engineered to secrete neurotrophic factors directly in the lesion site, could be important to promote regeneration in the injured spinal cord. Despite all the strategies used till now, the problem of the paraplegic rat remains. Only the solution of such problem will authorize studies in higher mammals and, finally, the clinical application in human patients. The paraplegic adult rat with a T8 spinal cord transection should be considered the standard experimental model to be used in spinal cord reconstruction studies. Function and anatomic results are undisputed only after spinal cord transection."
"The adult ""paraplegic"" rat: treatment with cell graftings","Fernandez E, Mannino S, Tufo T, Pallini R, Lauretti L, Albanese A, Denaro L.","AB  - Controlling muscle function is essential for human behaviour and survival, thus, impairment of motor function and muscle paralysis can severely impact quality of life and may be immediately life-threatening, as occurs in many cases of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) and in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Repairing damaged spinal motor circuits, in either SCI or ALS, currently remains an elusive goal. Therefore alternative strategies are needed to artificially control muscle function and thereby enable essential motor tasks. This review focuses on recent advances towards restoring motor function, with a particular focus on stem cell-derived neuronal engraftment strategies, optogenetic control of motor function and the potential future translational application of these approaches."
Oxygen-glucose deprivation in neurons: implications for cell transplantation therapies,"Rizzo SA, Bartley O, Rosser AE, Newland B.","AB  - Cell replacement therapies hold the potential to restore neuronal networks compromised by neurodegenerative diseases (such as Parkinson's disease or Huntington's disease), or focal tissue damage (via a stroke or spinal cord injury). Despite some promising results achieved to date, transplanted cells typically exhibit poor survival in the central nervous system, thus limiting therapeutic efficacy of the graft. Although cell death post-transplantation is likely to be multifactorial in causality, growing evidence suggests that the lack of vascularisation at the graft site, and the resulting ischemic host environment, may play a fundamental role in the fate of grafted cells. Herein, we summarise data showing how the deprivation of either oxygen, glucose, or both in combination, impacts the survival of neurons and review strategies which may improve graft survival in the central nervous system."
Reliable cell purification and determination of cell purity: crucial aspects of olfactory ensheathing cell transplantation for spinal cord repair,"Reshamwala R, Shah M, Belt L, Ekberg JAK, St John JA.","AB  - There is an array of new and promising strategies being developed to improve function after spinal cord injury (SCI). The targeting of a diversity of deleterious processes within the tissue after SCI will necessitate a multi-factorial intervention, such as the combination of cell- and gene-based approaches. To ensure proper development and design of these experiments, many issues need to be addressed. It is the purpose of this review to consider the strategies involved in testing the efficacy of these new combinations to improve axonal regeneration. For cell-based therapy, issues are choosing a SCI model, the time of cell implantation, placement of cells and their subsequent migration, fluid versus solid grafts, use of agents to prevent immune rejection, and tracking of implanted cells. Grafting is also discussed in view of improving function, reducing secondary damage, bridging the injured spinal cord, supporting axonal regrowth, replacing lost neurons, facilitating myelination, and promoting axonal growth from the implant into the cord. The choice of a gene delivery system, gene-based therapies in vivo to provide chemoattractant and guidance cues, altering the intrinsic regenerative capacity of neurons, enhancing endogenous non-neuronal cell functions, and targeting the synthesis of growth inhibitory molecules are also discussed, as well as combining ex vivo gene and cell therapies."
Designing cell- and gene-based regeneration strategies to repair the injured spinal cord,"Pearse DD, Bunge MB.","AB  - Transplantation of olfactory ensheathing cells, the glia of the primary olfactory nervous system, has been trialed for spinal cord injury repair with promising but variable outcomes in animals and humans. Olfactory ensheathing cells can be harvested either from the lamina propria beneath the neuroepithelium in the nasal cavity, or from the olfactory bulb in the brain. As these areas contain several other cell types, isolating and purifying olfactory ensheathing cells is a critical part of the process. It is largely unknown how contaminating cells such as fibroblasts, other glial cell types and supporting cells affect olfactory ensheathing cell function post-transplantation; these cells may also cause unwanted side-effects. It is also, however, possible that the presence of some of the contaminant cells can improve outcomes. Here, we reviewed the last decade of olfactory ensheathing cell transplantation studies in rodents, with a focus on olfactory ensheathing cell purity. We analyzed how purification methods and resultant cell purity differed between olfactory mucosa- and olfactory bulb-derived cell preparations. We analyzed how the studies reported on olfactory ensheathing cell purity and which criteria were used to define cells as olfactory ensheathing cells. Finally, we analyzed the correlation between cell purity and transplantation outcomes. We found that olfactory bulb-derived olfactory ensheathing cell preparations are typically purer than mucosa-derived preparations. We concluded that there is an association between high olfactory ensheathing cell purity and favourable outcomes, but the lack of olfactory ensheathing cell-specific markers severely hampers the field."

Designing a Clinical Trial with Olfactory Ensheathing Cell Transplantation-Based Therapy for Spinal Cord Injury: A Position Paper,"Reshamwala R, Murtaza M, Chen M, Shah M, Ekberg J, Palipana D, Vial ML, McMonagle B, St John J.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) represents an urgent unmet need for clinical reparative therapy due to its largely irreversible and devastating effects on patients, and the tremendous socioeconomic burden to the community. While different approaches are being explored, therapy to restore the lost function remains unavailable. Olfactory ensheathing cell (OEC) transplantation is a promising approach in terms of feasibility, safety, and limited efficacy; however, high variability in reported clinical outcomes prevent its translation despite several clinical trials. The aims of this position paper are to present an in-depth analysis of previous OEC transplantation-based clinical trials, identify existing challenges and gaps, and finally propose strategies to improve standardization of OEC therapies. We have reviewed the study design and protocols of clinical trials using OEC transplantation for SCI repair to investigate how and why the outcomes show variability. With this knowledge and our experience as a team of biologists and clinicians with active experience in the field of OEC research, we provide recommendations regarding cell source, cell purity and characterisation, transplantation dosage and format, and rehabilitation. Ultimately, this position paper is intended to serve as a roadmap to design an effective clinical trial with OEC transplantation-based therapy for SCI repair."

METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review following the guidelines and protocol of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). We searched the PubMed and EMBASE databases, screened titles and abstracts, and further evaluated full-text publications to select relevant studies. Additionally, a narrative review of other pertinent articles on PubMed was performed. Case reports, cohort studies, and clinical trials were included. Animal studies were excluded. RESULTS: Of 6 patients enrolled in this study, most had American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale grade A (66.7%) following intramedullary injury, and 1 patient had American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale grade D (16.65%). The discovery time of the intramedullary mass formation ranged from approximately 5 to 14 years. Surgical intervention was performed in most cases (66.7%), with improvement reported in 3 of the surgical cases (75%). The majority of cases (83.3%) involved cervical lesions, while only 1 case (16.7%) involved a thoracic lesion. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the scarcity of described cases, there is no specific treatment for this tumor. Although our patient remained stable after conservative treatment, other studies have shown improvement in symptoms after mass resection. It is essential that the management of this complication be researched further due to the variety of clinical characteristics presented."
Exosomes as promising bioactive materials in the treatment of spinal cord injury,"Li Y, Luo W, Meng C, Shi K, Gu R, Cui S.","AB  - Patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) have permanent devastating motor and sensory disabilities. Secondary SCI is known for its complex progression and presents with sophisticated aberrant inflammation, vascular changes, and secondary cellular dysfunction, which aggravate the primary damage. Since their initial discovery, the potent neuroprotective effects and powerful delivery abilities of exosomes (Exos) have been reported in different research fields, including SCI. In this study, we summarize therapeutic advances related to the application of Exos in preclinical animal studies. Subsequently, we discuss the mechanisms of action of Exos derived from diverse cell types, including neurogenesis, angiogenesis, blood-spinal cord barrier preservation, anti-apoptosis, and anti-inflammatory potential. We also evaluate the relationship between the Exo delivery cargo and signaling pathways. Finally, we discuss the challenges and advantages of using Exos to offer innovative insights regarding the development of efficient clinical strategies for SCI."

Cell based-gene delivery approaches for the treatment of spinal cord injury and neurodegenerative disorders,Taha MF.,"AB  - Cell based-gene delivery has provided an important therapeutic strategy for different disorders in the recent years. This strategy is based on the transplantation of genetically modified cells to express specific genes and to target the delivery of therapeutic factors, especially for the treatment of cancers and neurological, immunological, cardiovascular and heamatopoietic disorders. Although, preliminary reports are encouraging, and experimental studies indicate functionally and structurally improvements in the animal models of different disorders, universal application of this strategy for human diseases requires more evidence. There are a number of parameters that need to be evaluated, including the optimal cell source, the most effective gene/genes to be delivered, the optimal vector and method of gene delivery into the cells and the most efficient route for the delivery of genetically modified cells into the patient. Also, some obstacles have to be overcome, including the safety and usefulness of the approaches and the stability of the improvements. Here, recent studies concerning with the cell-based gene delivery for spinal cord injury and some neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease are briefly reviewed, and their exciting consequences are discussed."
Regulation of Inflammatory Cytokines for Spinal Cord Injury Repair Through Local Delivery of Therapeutic Agents,"Ren H, Chen X, Tian M, Zhou J, Ouyang H, Zhang Z.","AB  - The balance of inflammation is critical to the repair of spinal cord injury (SCI), which is one of the most devastating traumas in human beings. Inflammatory cytokines, the direct mediators of local inflammation, have differential influences on the repair of the injured spinal cord. Some inflammatory cytokines are demonstrated beneficial to spinal cord repair in SCI models, while some detrimental. Various animal researches have revealed that local delivery of therapeutic agents efficiently regulates inflammatory cytokines and promotes repair from SCI. Quite a few clinical studies have also shown the promotion of repair from SCI through regulation of inflammatory cytokines. However, local delivery of a single agent affects only a part of the inflammatory cytokines that need to be regulated. Meanwhile, different individuals have differential profiles of inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, future studies may aim to develop personalized strategies of locally delivered therapeutic agent cocktails for effective and precise regulation of inflammation, and substantial functional recovery from SCI."
Encapsulation of Human Spinal Cord Progenitor Cells in Hyaluronan-Gelatin Hydrogel for Spinal Cord Injury Treatment,"Kwokdinata C, Ramanujam V, Chen J, de Oliveira PN, Nai MH, Chooi WH, Lim CT, Ng SY, David L, Chew SY.","AB  - Transplanting human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived spinal cord progenitor cells (SCPCs) is a promising approach to treat spinal cord injuries. However, stem cell therapies face challenges in cell survival, cell localization to the targeted site, and the control of cell differentiation. Here, we encapsulated SCPCs in thiol-modified hyaluronan-gelatin hydrogels and optimized scaffold mechanical properties and cell encapsulation density to promote cell viability and neuronal differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Different compositions of hyaluronan-gelatin hydrogels formulated by varying concentrations of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate were mechanically characterized by using atomic force microscopy. In vitro SCPC encapsulation study showed higher cell viability and proliferation with lower substrate Young's modulus (200 Pa vs 580 Pa) and cell density. Moreover, the soft hydrogels facilitated a higher degree of neuronal differentiation with extended filament structures in contrast to clumped cellular morphologies obtained in stiff hydrogels (p < 0.01). When transplanted in vivo, the optimized SCPC-encapsulated hydrogels resulted in higher cell survival and localization at the transplanted region as compared to cell delivery without hydrogel encapsulation at 2 weeks postimplantation within the rat spinal cord (p < 0.01). Notably, immunostaining demonstrated that the hydrogel-encapsulated SCPCs differentiated along the neuronal and oligodendroglial lineages in vivo. The lack of pluripotency and proliferation also supported the safety of the SCPC transplantation approach. Overall, the injectable hyaluronan-gelatin hydrogel shows promise in supporting the survival and neural differentiation of human SCPCs after transplantation into the spinal cord."
Prospect of Stem Cell Therapy and Regenerative Medicine in Osteoporosis,"Arjmand B, Sarvari M, Alavi-Moghadam S, Payab M, Goodarzi P, Gilany K, Mehrdad N, Larijani B.","AB  - The field of cell therapy and regenerative medicine can hold the promise of restoring normal tissues structure and function. Additionally, the main targets of stem cell-based therapies are chronic diseases and lifelong disabilities without definite cures such as osteoporosis. Osteoporosis as one of the important causes of morbidity in older men and post-menopausal women is characterized by reduced bone quantity or skeletal tissue atrophy that leads to an increased risk of osteoporotic fractures. The common therapeutic methods for osteoporosis only can prevent the loss of bone mass and recover the bone partially. Nevertheless, stem cell-based therapy is considered as a new approach to regenerate the bone tissue. Herein, mesenchymal stem cells as pivotal candidates for regenerative medicine purposes especially bone regeneration are the most common type of cells with anti-inflammatory, immune-privileged potential, and less ethical concerns than other types of stem cells which are investigated in osteoporosis. Based on several findings, the mesenchymal stem cells effectiveness near to a great extent depends on their secretory function. Indeed, they can be involved in the establishment of normal bone remodeling via initiation of specific molecular signaling pathways. Accordingly, the aim herein was to review the effects of stem cell-based therapies in osteoporosis."
Multi-target approaches to CNS repair: olfactory mucosa-derived cells and heparan sulfates,"Lindsay SL, McCanney GA, Willison AG, Barnett SC.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) remains one of the biggest challenges in the development of neuroregenerative therapeutics. Cell transplantation is one of numerous experimental strategies that have been identified and tested for efficacy at both preclinical and clinical levels in recent years. In this Review, we briefly discuss the state of human olfactory cell transplantation as a therapy, considering both its current clinical status and its limitations. Furthermore, we introduce a mesenchymal stromal cell derived from human olfactory tissue, which has the potential to induce multifaceted reparative effects in the environment within and surrounding the lesion. We argue that no single therapy will be sufficient to treat SCI effectively and that a combination of cell-based, rehabilitation and pharmaceutical interventions is the most promising approach to aid repair. For this reason, we also introduce a novel pharmaceutical strategy based on modifying the activity of heparan sulfate, an important regulator of a wide range of biological cell functions. The multi-target approach that is exemplified by these types of strategies will probably be necessary to optimize SCI treatment."
Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells for spinal cord injury: a systematic review and network meta-analysis,"Chen WC, Liu WF, Bai YY, Zhou YY, Zhang Y, Wang CM, Lin S, He HF.","AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a severe traumatic disease of the central nervous system, with a global prevalence of 236-4187 per million people. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in treating patients with SCI as well as the optimal source and transplantation method of MSCs. PubMed, OVID, Cochrane, Web of Science, and China Biomedical Database were searched up until April 01, 2021. The study was conducted for five endpoints: American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor and sensory score, ASIA grade improvement, Barthel Index (BI), and adverse reactions. Standard meta-analysis and network meta-analysis were performed using Stata 14.0. Eighteen studies with a total of 949 patients, were included in the meta-analysis. Standard meta-analysis showed that MSCs significantly improved ASIA motor score (P < 0.001), sensory score (P < 0.001), ASIA grade (P < 0.001), and BI (P < 0.001) compared to rehabilitation. In addition, in the network meta-analysis, autologous MSCs significantly improved the ASIA motor [MD = 8.01, 95% CI (4.27, 11.76)], sensory score [MD = 17.98, 95% CI (10.04, 25.91)], and BI [MD = 7.69, 95% CI (2.10, 13.29)] compared to rehabilitation. Similarly, compared to rehabilitation, intrathecal injection (IT) of MSCs significantly improved the ASIA motor [MD = 7.97, 95% CI (4.40, 11.53)] and sensory score [MD = 19.60, 95% CI (9.74, 29.46)]. Compared to rehabilitation, however, only the IL of MSCs was associated with more adverse reactions [OR = 17.82, 95% CI (2.48, 128.22)]. According to the results of SUCRA, both autologous MSCs and IT transplantation approaches most improved the neurological function in SCI patients. Cell transplantation using MSCs is effective in patients with SCI and IT of autologous MSCs may be more beneficial."
"""Betwixt Mine Eye and Heart a League Is Took"": The Progress of Induced Pluripotent Stem-Cell-Based Models of Dystrophin-Associated Cardiomyopathy","Rovina D, Castiglioni E, Niro F, Mallia S, Pompilio G, Gowran A.","AB  - The ultimate goal of precision disease modeling is to artificially recreate the disease of affected people in a highly controllable and adaptable external environment. This field has rapidly advanced which is evident from the application of patient-specific pluripotent stem-cell-derived precision therapies in numerous clinical trials aimed at a diverse set of diseases such as macular degeneration, heart disease, spinal cord injury, graft-versus-host disease, and muscular dystrophy. Despite the existence of semi-adequate treatments for tempering skeletal muscle degeneration in dystrophic patients, nonischemic cardiomyopathy remains one of the primary causes of death. Therefore, cardiovascular cells derived from muscular dystrophy patients' induced pluripotent stem cells are well suited to mimic dystrophin-associated cardiomyopathy and hold great promise for the development of future fully effective therapies. The purpose of this article is to convey the realities of employing precision disease models of dystrophin-associated cardiomyopathy.

Non-Tumorigenic Pluripotent Reparative Muse Cells Provide a New Therapeutic Approach for Neurologic Diseases,"Yamashita T, Kushida Y, Abe K, Dezawa M.","AB  - Muse cells are non-tumorigenic endogenous reparative pluripotent cells with high therapeutic potential. They are identified as cells positive for the pluripotent surface marker SSEA-3 in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and connective tissue. Muse cells also express other pluripotent stem cell markers, are able to differentiate into cells representative of all three germ layers, self-renew from a single cell, and are stress tolerant. They express receptors for sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), which is actively produced by damaged cells, allowing circulating cells to selectively home to damaged tissue. Muse cells spontaneously differentiate on-site into multiple tissue-constituent cells with few errors and replace damaged/apoptotic cells with functional cells, thereby contributing to tissue repair. Intravenous injection of exogenous Muse cells to increase the number of circulating Muse cells enhances their reparative activity. Muse cells also have a specific immunomodulatory system, represented by HLA-G expression, allowing them to be directly administered without HLA-matching or immunosuppressant treatment. Owing to these unique characteristics, clinical trials using intravenously administered donor-Muse cells have been conducted for myocardial infarction, stroke, epidermolysis bullosa, spinal cord injury, perinatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Muse cells have the potential to break through the limitations of current cell therapies for neurologic diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Muse cells provide a new therapeutic strategy that requires no HLA-matching or immunosuppressant treatment for administering donor-derived cells, no gene introduction or differentiation induction for cell preparation, and no surgery for delivering the cells to patients."
Engineering biomaterial microenvironments to promote myelination in the central nervous system,"Unal DB, Caliari SR, Lampe KJ.","AB  - Promoting remyelination and/or minimizing demyelination are key therapeutic strategies under investigation for diseases and injuries like multiple sclerosis (MS), spinal cord injury, stroke, and virus-induced encephalopathy. Myelination is essential for efficacious neuronal signaling. This myelination process is originated by oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in the central nervous system (CNS). Resident OPCs are capable of both proliferation and differentiation, and also migration to demyelinated injury sites. OPCs can then engage with these unmyelinated or demyelinated axons and differentiate into myelin-forming oligodendrocytes (OLs). However this process is frequently incomplete and often does not occur at all. Biomaterial strategies can now be used to guide OPC and OL development with the goal of regenerating healthy myelin sheaths in formerly damaged CNS tissue. Growth and neurotrophic factors delivered from such materials can promote proliferation of OPCs or differentiation into OLs. While cell transplantation techniques have been used to replace damaged cells in wound sites, they have also resulted in poor transplant cell viability, uncontrollable differentiation, and poor integration into the host. Biomaterial scaffolds made from extracellular matrix (ECM) mimics that are naturally or synthetically derived can improve transplanted cell survival, support both transplanted and endogenous cell populations, and direct their fate. In particular, stiffness and degradability of these scaffolds are two parameters that can influence the fate of OPCs and OLs. The future outlook for biomaterials research includes 3D in vitro models of myelination / remyelination / demyelination to better mimic and study these processes. These models should provide simple relationships of myelination to microenvironmental biophysical and biochemical properties to inform improved therapeutic approaches."
Towards rationally designed biomanufacturing of therapeutic extracellular vesicles: impact of the bioproduction microenvironment,"Patel DB, Santoro M, Born LJ, Fisher JP, Jay SM.","AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, microvesicles, and others, have emerged as potential therapeutics for a variety of applications. Pre-clinical reports of EV efficacy in treatment of non-healing wounds, myocardial infarction, osteoarthritis, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and many other injuries and diseases demonstrate the versatility of this nascent therapeutic modality. EVs have also been demonstrated to be effective in humans, and clinical trials are underway to further explore their potential. However, for EVs to become a new class of clinical therapeutics, issues related to translation must be addressed. For example, approaches originally developed for cell biomanufacturing, such as hollow fiber bioreactor culture, have been adapted for EV production, but limited knowledge of how the cell culture microenvironment specifically impacts EVs restricts the possibility for rational design and optimization of EV production and potency. In this review, we discuss current knowledge of this issue and delineate potential focus areas for future research towards enabling translation and widespread application of EV-based therapeutics."
Immunomodulatory biomaterials and their application in therapies for chronic inflammation-related diseases,"Nakkala JR, Li Z, Ahmad W, Wang K, Gao C.","AB  - The degree of tissue injuries such as the level of scarring or organ dysfunction, and the immune response against them primarily determine the outcome and speed of healing process. The successful regeneration of functional tissues requires proper modulation of inflammation-producing immune cells and bioactive factors existing in the damaged microenvironment. In the tissue repair and regeneration processes, different types of biomaterials are implanted either alone or by combined with other bioactive factors, which will interact with the immune systems including immune cells, cytokines and chemokines etc. to achieve different results highly depending on this interplay. In this review article, the influences of different types of biomaterials such as nanoparticles, hydrogels and scaffolds on the immune cells and the modification of immune-responsive factors such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), cytokines, chemokines, enzymes, and metalloproteinases in tissue microenvironment are summarized. In addition, the recent advances of immune-responsive biomaterials in therapy of inflammation-associated diseases such as myocardial infarction, spinal cord injury, osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and diabetic ulcer are discussed."
Nanotechnologies in regenerative medicine,"Kubinová S, Syková E.","AB  - Traumatic injury to the brain or spinal cord and multiple sclerosis (MS) share a common pathophysiology with regard to axonal demyelination. Despite advances in central nervous system (CNS) repair in experimental animal models, adequate functional recovery has yet to be achieved in patients in response to any of the current strategies. Functional recovery is dependent, in large part, upon remyelination of spared or regenerating axons. The mammalian CNS maintains an endogenous reservoir of glial precursor cells (GPCs), capable of generating new oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. These GPCs are upregulated following traumatic or demyelinating lesions, followed by their differentiation into oligodendrocytes. However, this innate response does not adequately promote remyelination. As a result, researchers have been focusing their efforts on harvesting, culturing, characterizing, and transplanting GPCs into injured regions of the adult mammalian CNS in a variety of animal models of CNS trauma or demyelinating disease. The technical and logistic considerations for transplanting GPCs are extensive and crucial for optimizing and maintaining cell survival before and after transplantation, promoting myelination, and tracking the fate of transplanted cells. This is especially true in trials of GPC transplantation in combination with other strategies such as neutralization of inhibitors to axonal regeneration or remyelination. Overall, such studies improve our understanding and approach to developing clinically relevant therapies for axonal remyelination following traumatic brain injury (TBI) or spinal cord injury (SCI) and demyelinating diseases such as MS."
Glial precursor cell transplantation therapy for neurotrauma and multiple sclerosis,"Kulbatski I, Mothe AJ, Parr AM, Kim H, Kang CE, Bozkurt G, Tator CH.","AB  - Nanotechnology offers promising perspectives in biomedical research as well as in clinical practice. To cover some of the latest nanotechnology trends in regenerative medicine, this review will focus on the use of nanomaterials for tissue engineering and cell therapy. Nanofibrous materials that mimic the native extracellular matrix and promote the adhesion of various cells are being developed as tissue-engineered scaffolds for the skin, bone, vasculature, heart, cornea, nervous system, and other tissues. A range of novel materials has been developed to enhance the bioactive or therapeutic properties of these nanofibrous scaffolds via surface modifications, including the immobilization of functional cell-adhesive ligands and bioactive molecules such as drugs, enzymes and cytokines. As a new approach, nanofibers prepared by using industrial scale needleless technology have been recently introduced, and their use as scaffolds to treat spinal cord injury or as cell carriers for the regeneration of the injured cornea is the subject of much current study. Cell therapy is a modern approach of regenerative medicine for the treatment of various diseases or injuries. To follow the migration and fate of transplanted cells, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles have been developed for cell labeling and non-invasive MRI monitoring of cells in the living organism, with successful applications in, e.g, the central nervous system, heart, liver and kidney and also in pancreatic islet and stem cell transplantation."
Global research trends and hotspots of artificial intelligence research in spinal cord neural injury and restoration-a bibliometrics and visualization analysis,"Tao G, Yang S, Xu J, Wang L, Yang B.","AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has made breakthroughs in spinal cord neural injury and restoration in recent years. It has a positive impact on clinical treatment. This study explores AI research's progress and hotspots in spinal cord neural injury and restoration. It also analyzes research shortcomings related to this area and proposes potential solutions. METHODS: We used CiteSpace 6.1.R6 and VOSviewer 1.6.19 to research WOS articles on AI research in spinal cord neural injury and restoration. RESULTS: A total of 1,502 articles were screened, in which the United States dominated; Kadone, Hideki (13 articles, University of Tsukuba, JAPAN) was the author with the highest number of publications; ARCH PHYS MED REHAB (IF = 4.3) was the most cited journal, and topics included molecular biology, immunology, neurology, sports, among other related areas. CONCLUSION: We pinpointed three research hotspots for AI research in spinal cord neural injury and restoration: (1) intelligent robots and limb exoskeletons to assist rehabilitation training; (2) brain-computer interfaces; and (3) neuromodulation and noninvasive electrical stimulation. In addition, many new hotspots were discussed: (1) starting with image segmentation models based on convolutional neural networks; (2) the use of AI to fabricate polymeric biomaterials to provide the microenvironment required for neural stem cell-derived neural network tissues; (3) AI survival prediction tools, and transcription factor regulatory networks in the field of genetics were discussed. Although AI research in spinal cord neural injury and restoration has many benefits, the technology has several limitations (data and ethical issues). The data-gathering problem should be addressed in future research, which requires a significant sample of quality clinical data to build valid AI models. At the same time, research on genomics and other mechanisms in this field is fragile. In the future, machine learning techniques, such as AI survival prediction tools and transcription factor regulatory networks, can be utilized for studies related to the up-regulation of regeneration-related genes and the production of structural proteins for axonal growth."
Stem cell-based models and therapies: a key approach into schizophrenia treatment,"Larijani B, Parhizkar Roudsari P, Hadavandkhani M, Alavi-Moghadam S, Rezaei-Tavirani M, Goodarzi P, Sayahpour FA, Mohamadi-Jahani F, Arjmand B.","AB  - Psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia can generate distress and disability along with heavy costs on individuals and health care systems. Different genetic and environmental factors play a pivotal role in the appearance of the mentioned disorders. Since the conventional treatment options for psychiatric disorders are suboptimal, investigators are trying to find novel strategies. Herein, stem cell therapies have been recommended as novel choices. In this context, the preclinical examination of stem cell-based therapies specifically using appropriate models can facilitate passing strong filters and serious examination to ensure proper quality and safety of them as a novel treatment approach. Animal models cannot be adequately helpful to follow pathophysiological features. Nowadays, stem cell-based models, particularly induced pluripotent stem cells reflected as suitable alternative models in this field. Accordingly, the importance of stem cell-based models, especially to experiment with the regenerative medicine outcomes for schizophrenia as one of the severe typing of psychiatric disorders, is addressed here."
Schwann Cell-Derived Exosomal Vesicles: A Promising Therapy for the Injured Spinal Cord,"Ghosh M, Pearse DD.","AB  - Exosomes are nanoscale-sized membrane vesicles released by cells into their extracellular milieu. Within these nanovesicles reside a multitude of bioactive molecules, which orchestrate essential biological processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival, in the recipient cells. These bioactive properties of exosomes render them a promising choice for therapeutic use in the realm of tissue regeneration and repair. Exosomes possess notable positive attributes, including a high bioavailability, inherent safety, and stability, as well as the capacity to be functionalized so that drugs or biological agents can be encapsulated within them or to have their surface modified with ligands and receptors to imbue them with selective cell or tissue targeting. Remarkably, their small size and capacity for receptor-mediated transcytosis enable exosomes to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and access the central nervous system (CNS). Unlike cell-based therapies, exosomes present fewer ethical constraints in their collection and direct use as a therapeutic approach in the human body. These advantageous qualities underscore the vast potential of exosomes as a treatment option for neurological injuries and diseases, setting them apart from other cell-based biological agents. Considering the therapeutic potential of exosomes, the current review seeks to specifically examine an area of investigation that encompasses the development of Schwann cell (SC)-derived exosomal vesicles (SCEVs) as an approach to spinal cord injury (SCI) protection and repair. SCs, the myelinating glia of the peripheral nervous system, have a long history of demonstrated benefit in repair of the injured spinal cord and peripheral nerves when transplanted, including their recent advancement to clinical investigations for feasibility and safety in humans. This review delves into the potential of utilizing SCEVs as a therapy for SCI, explores promising engineering strategies to customize SCEVs for specific actions, and examines how SCEVs may offer unique clinical advantages over SC transplantation for repair of the injured spinal cord."
Metabolomics Analysis of Mesenchymal Stem Cells,"Goodarzi P, Alavi-Moghadam S, Payab M, Larijani B, Rahim F, Gilany K, Bana N, Tayanloo-Beik A, Foroughi Heravani N, Hadavandkhani M, Arjmand B.","AB  - Various mesenchymal stem cells as easily accessible and multipotent cells can share different essential signaling pathways related to their stemness ability. Understanding the mechanism of stemness ability can be useful for controlling the stem cells for regenerative medicine targets. In this context, OMICs studies can analyze the mechanism of different stem cell properties or stemness ability via a broad range of current high-throughput techniques. This field is fundamentally directed toward the analysis of whole genome (genomics), mRNAs (transcriptomics), proteins (proteomics) and metabolites (metabolomics) in biological samples. According to several studies, metabolomics is more effective than other OMICs ّfor various system biology concerns. Metabolomics can elucidate the biological mechanisms of various mesenchymal stem cell function by measuring their metabolites such as their secretome components. Analyzing the metabolic alteration of mesenchymal stem cells can be useful to promote their regenerative medicine application."
The Outcome of Stem Cell-Based Therapies on the Immune Responses in Rheumatoid Arthritis,"Roudsari PP, Alavi-Moghadam S, Rezaei-Tavirani M, Goodarzi P, Tayanloo-Beik A, Sayahpour FA, Larijani B, Arjmand B.","AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis as a common autoimmune inflammatory disorder with unknown etiology can affect 0.5-1% of adults in developed countries. It involves more than just the patient's joints and can be accompanied by several comorbidities and affect cardiovascular, pulmonary, and some other systems of the human body. Although cytokine-mediated pathways are mentioned to have a central role in RA pathogenesis, adaptive and innate immune systems and intracellular signaling pathways all have important roles in this process. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, and biological agents are some mentioned medications used for RA. They are accompanied by some adverse effects and treatment failures which elucidates the needing for novel and more powerful therapeutic approaches. Stem cell-based therapies and their beneficial effects on therapeutic processes of different diseases have been founded so far. They can be an alternative and promising therapeutic approach for RA, too; due to their effects on immune responses of the disease. This review, besides some explanations about RA characteristics, addresses the outcome of the stem cell-based therapies including mesenchymal stem cell transplantation and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for RA and explains their effects on the disease improvement."
Effects and mechanisms of Apelin in treating central nervous system diseases,"Huang Z, Liu Q, Guo Q, Gao J, Zhang L, Li L.","AB  - Apelin, an endogenous ligand of G protein-coupled receptor APJ, is widely distributed in the central nervous system (CNS). It can be divided into such subtypes as Apelin-13, Apelin-17, and Apelin-36 as they have different amino acid structures. All Apelin is widely studied as an adipokine, showing a significant protective effect through regulating apoptosis, autophagy, oxidative stress, angiogenesis, inflammation, and other pathophysiological processes. As an adipokine, Apelin has been found to play a crucial role in cardiovascular disease development. In this paper, we reviewed the effects and mechanisms of Apelin in treating CNS diseases, such as neurotrauma, stroke, spinal cord injury, primary tumors, neurodegenerative diseases, psychiatric diseases, epilepsy, and pain."
Mesenchymal stem cell as a novel approach to systemic sclerosis; current status and future perspectives,"Abedi M, Alavi-Moghadam S, Payab M, Goodarzi P, Mohamadi-Jahani F, Sayahpour FA, Larijani B, Arjmand B.","AB  - Systemic sclerosis is a rare chronic autoimmune disease with extensive microvascular injury, damage of endothelial cells, activation of immune responses, and progression of tissue fibrosis in the skin and various internal organs. According to epidemiological data, women's populations are more susceptible to systemic sclerosis than men. Until now, various therapeutic options are employed to manage the symptoms of the disease. Since stem cell-based treatments have developed as a novel approach to rescue from several autoimmune diseases, it seems that stem cells, especially mesenchymal stem cells as a powerful regenerative tool can also be advantageous for systemic sclerosis treatment via their remarkable properties including immunomodulatory and anti-fibrotic effects. Accordingly, we discuss the contemporary status and future perspectives of mesenchymal stem cell transplantation for systemic sclerosis."
"Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs)-Roles in Regenerative Therapies, Disease Modelling and Drug Screening","Aboul-Soud MAM, Alzahrani AJ, Mahmoud A.","AB  - The discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has made an invaluable contribution to the field of regenerative medicine, paving way for identifying the true potential of human embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Since the controversy around ethicality of ESCs continue to be debated, iPSCs have been used to circumvent the process around destruction of the human embryo. The use of iPSCs have transformed biological research, wherein increasing number of studies are documenting nuclear reprogramming strategies to make them beneficial models for drug screening as well as disease modelling. The flexibility around the use of iPSCs include compatibility to non-invasive harvesting, and ability to source from patients with rare diseases. iPSCs have been widely used in cardiac disease modelling, studying inherited arrhythmias, neural disorders including Alzheimer's disease, liver disease, and spinal cord injury. Extensive research around identifying factors that are involved in maintaining the identity of ESCs during induction of pluripotency in somatic cells is undertaken. The focus of the current review is to detail all the clinical translation research around iPSCs and the strength of its ever-growing potential in the clinical space."
Repairing the damaged spinal cord: a summary of our early success with embryonic stem cell transplantation and remyelination,"McDonald JW, Howard MJ.","AB  - Neural precursors that are found in the subventricular zone and dentate gyrus of the adult brain might be useful in cell replacement therapies for neurological disorders. The development of pharmacological drugs that would increase production of new neurons would be facilitated by identification of the endogenous or natural molecular regulators of adult neurogenesis in vivo. This review discusses known endogenous regulators of the cellular events that are required for functional neurogenesis in adult animals. These steps include proliferation of stem cells and progenitors, survival and migration of new neuroblasts, differentiation into mature neurons and functional integration into existing neural circuits. Various treatments have been shown to enhance neurogenesis and neuroblast migration in adult rodents, raising the possibility that these resident neural stem cells could be used to treat people with neurological disorders. This review also highlights some of the potential problems and limitations that may arise when considering such therapies."
Endogenous regulators of adult CNS neurogenesis,Hagg T.,"AB  - Demyelination contributes to the loss of function consequent to central nervous system (CNS) injury. Optimizing remyelination through transplantation of myelin-producing cells may offer a pragmatic approach to restoring meaningful neurological function. An unlimited source of cell suitable for such transplantation therapy can be derived from embryonic stem (ES) cells, which are both pluripotent and genetically flexible. Here we review work from our group showing that neural precursor cells can be derived from ES cells and that transplantation of these cells into the injured spinal cord leads to some recovery of function. We have further examined and optimized methods for enriching oligodendrocyte differentiation from ES cells. ES cell-derived oligodendrocytes are capable of rapid differentiation and myelination in mixed neuron/glia cultures. When transplanted into the injured spinal cord of adult rodents, the neural-induced precursor cells are capable of differentiating into oligodendrocytes and myelinating host axons. The role of myelination and remyelination will be discussed in the context of regeneration strategies."
Peripheral blood mononuclear cell secretome for tissue repair,"Beer L, Mildner M, Gyöngyösi M, Ankersmit HJ.","AB  - For almost two decades, cell-based therapies have been tested in modern regenerative medicine to either replace or regenerate human cells, tissues, or organs and restore normal function. Secreted paracrine factors are increasingly accepted to exert beneficial biological effects that promote tissue regeneration. These factors are called the cell secretome and include a variety of proteins, lipids, microRNAs, and extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes and microparticles. The stem cell secretome has most commonly been investigated in pre-clinical settings. However, a growing body of evidence indicates that other cell types, such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), are capable of releasing significant amounts of biologically active paracrine factors that exert beneficial regenerative effects. The apoptotic PBMC secretome has been successfully used pre-clinically for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, chronic heart failure, spinal cord injury, stroke, and wound healing. In this review we describe the benefits of choosing PBMCs instead of stem cells in regenerative medicine and characterize the factors released from apoptotic PBMCs. We also discuss pre-clinical studies with apoptotic cell-based therapies and regulatory issues that have to be considered when conducting clinical trials using cell secretome-based products. This should allow the reader to envision PBMC secretome-based therapies as alternatives to all other forms of cell-based therapies."
Mesenchymal stem cell-based therapies for treating well-studied neurological disorders: a systematic review,"Patel GD, Liu L, Li A, Yang YH, Shen CC, Brand-Saberi B, Yang X.","AB  - BACKGROUND: Millions of people across the globe are affected by conditions like Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's Disease (PD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Spinal Cord Injury (SCI), and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), although most occurrences are common in the elderly population. This systematic review aims to highlight the safety of the procedures, their tolerability, and efficacy of the available therapies conducted over the years using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in treating the neurological conditions mentioned above. METHODS: PubMed was used to search for published data from clinical trials performed using mesenchymal stem cells. Studies that provided the necessary information that mentioned the efficacy and adverse effects of the treatment in patients were considered for this review. RESULTS: In total, 43 manuscripts were selected after a strategic search, and these studies have been included in this systematic review. Most included studies reported the safety of the procedures used and the treatment's good tolerability, with mild adverse events such as fever, headache, mild pain at the injection site, or nausea being common. A few studies also reported death of some patients, attributed to the progression of the disease to severe stages before the treatment. Other severe events, such as respiratory or urinary infections reported in some studies, were not related to the treatment. Different parameters were used to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment based on the clinical condition of the patient. CONCLUSION: Mesenchymal stem cells transplantation has so far proven to be safe and tolerable in select studies and patient types. This systematic review includes the results from the 43 selected studies in terms of safety and tolerability of the procedures, and several adverse events and therapeutic benefits during the follow-up period after administration of MSCs."
The therapeutic potential of human olfactory-derived stem cells,"Marshall CT, Lu C, Winstead W, Zhang X, Xiao M, Harding G, Klueber KM, Roisen FJ.","AB  - Stem cells from fetal and adult central nervous system have been isolated and characterized, providing populations for potential replacement therapy for traumatic injury repair and neurodegenerative diseases. The regenerative capacity of the olfactory system has attracted scientific interest. Studies focusing on animal and human olfactory bulb ensheathing cells (OECs) have heightened the expectations that OECs can enhance axonal regeneration and repair demyelinating diseases. Harvest of OECs from the olfactory bulb requires highly invasive surgery, which is a major obstacle. In contrast, olfactory epithelium (OE) has a unique regenerative capacity and is readily accessible from its location in the nasal cavity, allowing for harvest without lasting damage to the donor. Adult OE contains progenitors responsible for the normal life-long continuous replacement of neurons and supporting cells. Culture techniques have been established for human OE that generate populations of mitotically active neural progenitors that form neurospheres (Roisen et al., 2001; Winstead et al., 2005). The potential application of this technology includes autologous transplantation where minimal donor material can be isolated, expanded ex vivo, and lineage restricted to a desired phenotype prior to/or after re-implantation. Furthermore, these strategies circumvent the ethical issues that arise with embryonic or fetal tissues. The long term goal is to develop procedures through which a victim of a spinal cord injury or neurodegenerative condition would serve as a source of progenitors for his/her own regenerative grafts, avoiding the need for immunosuppression and ethical controversy. In addition, these cells can provide populations for pharmacological and/or diagnostic evaluation."
Rewiring the spinal cord: Direct and indirect strategies,"Dell'Anno MT, Strittmatter SM.","AB  - Spinal cord injury is currently incurable. Treatment is limited to minimizing secondary complications and maximizing residual function by rehabilitation. Neurologic recovery is prevented by the poor intrinsic regenerative capacity of neurons in the adult central nervous system and by the presence of growth inhibitors in the adult brain and spinal cord. Here we identify three approaches to rewire the spinal cord after injury: axonal regeneration (direct endogenous reconnection), axonal sprouting (indirect endogenous reconnection) and neural stem cell transplantation (indirect exogenous reconnection). Regeneration and sprouting of axonal fibers can be both enhanced through the neutralization of myelin- and extracellular matrix-associated inhibitors described in the first part of this review. Alternatively, in the second part we focus on the formation of a novel circuit through the grafting of neural stem cells in the lesion site. Transplanted neural stem cells differentiate in vivo into neurons and glial cells which form an intermediate station between the rostral and caudal segment of the recipient spinal cord. In particular, here we describe how neural stem cells-derived neurons are endowed with the ability to extend long-distance axons to regain the transmission of motor and sensory information."

An update on the role of miR-379 in human disorders,"Ghafouri-Fard S, Shaterabadi D, Abak A, Shoorei H, Bahroudi Z, Taheri M, Mousavinejad SA.","AB  - miR-379 is a miRNA transcribed from the MIR379 locus on 14q32.31. This miRNA is located in an evolutionarily conserved miRNA cluster in an imprinted region that contains DLK1 and DIO3 genes. The mouse homolog of this miRNA has been shown to be under-expressed in response to glucocorticoid receptor deficiency. Moreover, miR-379 has a tumor-suppressive role in a wide variety of tissues including the brain, breast, lung, and liver. In addition to restraining cell proliferation and migration, miR-379 can suppress the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process. Abnormal expression of this miRNA implies the pathogenesis of Duchene muscular dystrophy, spinal cord injury, diabetic nephropathy, acute myocardial infarction, and premature ovarian failure. This review aims to the summarization of the role of miR-379 in neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions."

Therefore, understanding its mechanism to find novel therapeutic alternatives for age-related disorders such as neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases is essential. Stem cell senescence plays an important role in aging. In the context of the underlying pathways, mitochondrial dysfunction, epigenetic and genetic alterations, and other mechanisms have been studied and as a consequence, several rejuvenation strategies targeting these mechanisms like pharmaceutical interventions, genetic modification, and cellular reprogramming have been proposed. On the other hand, since stem cells have great potential for disease modeling, they have been useful for representing aging and its associated disorders. Accordingly, the main mechanisms of senescence in stem cells and promising ways of rejuvenation, along with some examples of stem cell models for aging are introduced and discussed. This review aims to prepare a comprehensive summary of the findings by focusing on the most recent ones to shine a light on this area of research."

"Medical Gas Therapy for Tissue, Organ, and CNS Protection: A Systematic Review of Effects, Mechanisms, and Challenges","Zafonte RD, Wang L, Arbelaez CA, Dennison R, Teng YD.","AB  - Acute brain injuries cause rapid cell death that activates bidirectional crosstalk between the injured brain and the immune system. In the acute phase, the damaged CNS activates resident and circulating immune cells via the local and systemic release of soluble mediators. This early immune activation is necessary to confine the injured tissue and foster the clearance of cellular debris, thus bringing the inflammatory reaction to a close. In the chronic phase, a sustained immune activation has been described in many CNS disorders, and the degree of this prolonged response has variable effects on spontaneous brain regenerative processes. The challenge for treating acute CNS damage is to understand how to optimally engage and modify these immune responses, thus providing new strategies that will compensate for tissue lost to injury. Herein we have reviewed the available information regarding the role and function of the innate and adaptive immune responses in influencing CNS plasticity during the acute and chronic phases of after injury. We have examined how CNS damage evolves along the activation of main cellular and molecular pathways that are associated with intrinsic repair, neuronal functional plasticity and facilitation of tissue reorganization."
Dental Pulp from Human Exfoliated Deciduous Teeth-derived Stromal Cells Demonstrated Neuronal Potential: In Vivo and In Vitro Studies,"Hochuli AHD, Senegaglia AC, Selenko AH, Fracaro L, Brofman PRS.","AB  - BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC) have the potential for self-renewal and differentiation in different tissues, characteristics that encourage their use in regenerative medicine. Dental tissue MSCs are easy to collect, have the same embryonic origin as neurons and have neuronal markers that allow their use in treating neurodegenerative diseases. Human Exfoliated Deciduous teeth (SHED)-derived stromal cells are considered immature and present positive expression of pluripotency and neuronal markers. Studies have shown that after the induction of neuronal differentiation in vitro, SHED increased the expression of neuronal markers, such as βIIItubulin, nestin, GFAP, NeuN, and NFM, demonstrating the potential use of these cells in preclinical studies. The results of this review reflect the consensus that in diseases such as spinal cord injury, cerebral ischaemia, and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, SHED could function in the suppression of the inflammatory response, neuroprotection, and neuronal replacement. CONCLUSION: For these cells to be used in large-scale clinical trials, standardization of the isolation techniques and theneuronal induction medium are necessary. The potential of SHED to induce neuronal differentiation is evident, demonstrating that this resource is promising and shows great potential for use in future preclinical and clinical trials of neurodegenerative diseases."
"Isolation and long-term expansion of functional, myelinating oligodendrocyte progenitor cells from neonatal rat brain","Zhu B, Zhao C, Young FI, Franklin RJ, Song B.","AB  - Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating cells of the central nervous system (CNS). The isolation of purified oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in large numbers has been sought after as a source of cells for repair following CNS-demyelinating diseases and injuries, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and spinal cord injury (SCI). Methods for isolation of OPCs from rodent neonatal brains are well established and have formed the basis for research in myelin repair within the CNS for many years. However, long-term maintenance of OPCs has been a challenge owing to small cellular yields per animal and spontaneous differentiation within a short period of time. Much effort has been devoted to achieving long-term culture and maintenance of OPCs, but little progress has been made. Here, protocols are presented for preparation of highly enriched rat OPC populations and for their long-term maintenance as oligospheres using mixed-glial-conditioned medium. Functional myelinating oligodendrocytes can be achieved from such protocols, when co-cultured with primary neurons. This approach is an extension of our normal shaking method for isolating OPCs, and incorporates some adaptations from previous OPC culture methods."
Tissue regeneration: from synthetic scaffolds to self-organizing morphogenesis,Chen TH.,"AB  - Regenerative medicine offers therapeutic approaches to treating non-regenerative diseases such as spinal cord injury and heart disease. Owing to the limited donor tissue available, cell-based therapy using cultured cells with supporting scaffolds has been proposed to rebuild damaged tissue. Early attempts at repairing skin and cartilage achieved significant success thanks to the simplicity of the tissue architecture, which later fueled enthusiasm for applying the same strategy to other types of tissue. However, more complex tissue functions require a more extensive vasculature and heterogeneous cell arrangements, which together constitute a significant hurdle in practical applications. Accordingly, recent years an increased interest has been in the use of decellularized matrices that retain the natural microarchitecture as the scaffold. However, although a number of engineering approaches have been suggested, self-organizing behavior such as cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation may still disorganize and frustrate the artificial attempts. This mini-review first provides examples of the early history of tissue engineering using skin and cartilage as examples, and then elaborates on the key technologies used to fabricate synthetic acellular scaffolds and cell/scaffold constructs with more complicated architectures. It also summarizes the progress achieved in the use of decellularized matrices for cell seeding as well as the recent success seen in self-organizing two- and three-dimensional tissue formation with the aid of biomathematical modeling. The review concludes by proposing the future integration of biomathematics, developmental biology, and engineering in concert with the self-organization approach to tissue regeneration."

In coronavirus disease-2019 infection, a cytokine storm contributes to the mortality rate of the disease and can lead to multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome through auto-destructive responses of systemic inflammation. Direct effects of the severe acute respiratory syndrome associated with infection as well as hyperinflammatory reactions are in association with disease complications. Besides acute respiratory distress syndrome, functional impairments of the cardiovascular system, central nervous system, kidneys, liver, and several others can be mentioned as the possible consequences. In addition to the current therapeutic approaches for coronavirus disease-2019, which are mostly supportive, stem cell-based therapies have shown the capacity for controlling the inflammation and attenuating the cytokine storm. Therefore, after a brief review of novel coronavirus characteristics, this review aims to explain the effects of coronavirus disease-2019 cytokine storm on different organs of the human body. The roles of stem cell-based therapies on attenuating cytokine release syndrome are also stated."
Investigational Therapies for Gunshot Wounds to the Spine: A Narrative Review,"Somuncu D, Gartenberg A, Cho W.","AB  - STUDY DESIGN: This was a narrative review. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to review the standards of care and triage protocol for gunshot wounds to the spine, highlighting innovative future treatment options that may be implemented in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: With the increased availability of firearms among the United States population, gunshot wounds to the spine are becoming a clinically relevant and devastating issue. Such injuries result in severe and diverse complications. SCIs due to gunshot wounds are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, as they often result in complete or incomplete paraplegia. Current standards of care focus on preventing further damage rather than total cure or treatment of SCI. METHODS: A literature review was performed on the standards of care, triage protocol, associated conditions, current therapeutic options, and innovative treatment options for patients with gunshot wounds to the spine. RESULTS: The general standards of care for spinal gunshot wounds involve maintaining or renewal of mechanical spinal steadiness and neurological activity while limiting complications of treatment. Current treatment options include management of mean arterial pressure goals, drug therapies consisting of antibiotics, and surgical approaches. With recent innovations in molecular biology and cell transplantation, potentially new and promising treatment options for patients with SCI exist. These options include cell transplantation therapies, platelet-rich plasma administration, exosomal treatments, and mitochondrial-targeted therapeutics. Stem cell transplantation is promising, as several clinical studies have been completed. However, loss-to-follow-up, lack of long-term evaluation, and questionable randomization has limited the use of stem cells in the standard of care practice. Although not studied on human models to a gunshot wound, exosomal and mitochondrial-based treatment options have been studied both in vitro and in animal models with SCI. CONCLUSION: Newly emerging molecular and cellular therapy modalities for SCI contribute to the recovery process and may be utilized in conjunction with the current modalities for better outcomes."
The frequency of osteomyelitis after pressure injury in spinal cord injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Jangholi E, Alizadeh SD, Farahbakhsh F, Baigi V, Ghodsi Z, Mahdavi Sharif P, Ghashghaei S, Abbaszadeh M, Zeinaddini Meymand A, Eskandari Z, Rahimi-Movaghar V.","AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis OBJECTIVE: To determine the global frequency of osteomyelitis in individuals with spinal cord injury who have pressure injuries (SCI-PI). METHODS: A comprehensive search on PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Web of Science has been conducted until November 2023. The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews was followed. Cohort and cross-sectional studies included SCI-PI participants who reported the frequency of osteomyelitis without language restriction. Data extraction was performed by four reviewers in two groups. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for quality assessment. The Chi-squared and I(2) tests were applied to detect heterogeneity between studies. Also, a random-effects model was performed for the report data. RESULTS: Ten out of 986 studies met our eligibility criteria, with 492 SCI-PI individuals. It was discovered that most SCIs were thoracolumbar injuries and male. There was a history of PI in more than half the patients. SCI was primarily caused by trauma. A meta-analysis revealed a significantly heterogeneous 43.0% osteomyelitis frequency. There was no evidence of publication bias. Subgroup analysis based on study quality revealed that the frequency of osteomyelitis in low-quality studies was 34.5%, whereas the frequency in high-quality research was 47.4%. Furthermore, the overall frequency of osteomyelitis was 29.0% in the subgroup analysis of research carried out in the USA. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the significant burden of osteomyelitis among SCI-PI individuals. These findings underscore the pressing need for standardized diagnostic and management protocols to mitigate the morbidity associated with osteomyelitis in this vulnerable population."
The role of the serotonergic system in locomotor recovery after spinal cord injury,"Ghosh M, Pearse DD.","AB  - Serotonin (5-HT), a monoamine neurotransmitter synthesized in various populations of brainstem neurons, plays an important role in modulating the activity of spinal networks involved in vertebrate locomotion. Following spinal cord injury (SCI) there is a disruption of descending serotonergic projections to spinal motor areas, which results in a subsequent depletion in 5-HT, the dysregulation of 5-HT transporters as well as the elevated expression, super-sensitivity and/or constitutive auto-activation of specific 5-HT receptors. These changes in the serotonergic system can produce varying degrees of locomotor dysfunction through to paralysis. To date, various approaches targeting the different components of the serotonergic system have been employed to restore limb coordination and improve locomotor function in experimental models of SCI. These strategies have included pharmacological modulation of serotonergic receptors, through the administration of specific 5-HT receptor agonists, or by elevating the 5-HT precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan, which produces a global activation of all classes of 5-HT receptors. Stimulation of these receptors leads to the activation of the locomotor central pattern generator (CPG) below the site of injury to facilitate or improve the quality and frequency of movements, particularly when used in concert with the activation of other monoaminergic systems or coupled with electrical stimulation. Another approach has been to employ cell therapeutics to replace the loss of descending serotonergic input to the CPG, either through transplanted fetal brainstem 5-HT neurons at the site of injury that can supply 5-HT to below the level of the lesion or by other cell types to provide a substrate at the injury site for encouraging serotonergic axon regrowth across the lesion to the caudal spinal cord for restoring locomotion."
Enhancing CNS repair in neurological disease: challenges arising from neurodegeneration and rewiring of the network,"Xu X, Warrington AE, Bieber AJ, Rodriguez M.","AB  - Repair of the central nervous system (CNS) constitutes an integral part of treating neurological disease and plays a crucial role in restoring CNS architecture and function. Distinct strategies have been developed to reconstruct the damaged neural tissue, with many tested preclinically in animal models. We review cell replacement-based repair strategies. By taking spinal cord injury, cerebral ischaemia and degenerative CNS disorders as examples for CNS repair, we discuss progress and potential problems in utilizing embryonic stem cells and adult neural/non-neural stem cells to repair cell loss in the CNS. Nevertheless, CNS repair is not simply a matter of cell transplantation. The major challenge is to induce regenerating neural cells to integrate into the neural network and compensate for damaged neural function. The neural cells confront an environment very different from that of the developmental stage in which these cells differentiate to form interwoven networks. During the repair process, one of the challenges is neurodegeneration, which can develop from interrupted innervations to/from the targets, chronic inflammation, ischaemia, aging or idiopathic neural toxicity. Neurodegeneration, which occurs on the basis of a characteristic vascular and neural web, usually presents as a chronically progressive process with unknown aetiology. Currently, there is no effective treatment to stop or slow down neurodegeneration. Pathological changes from patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis indicate a broken homeostasis in the CNS. We discuss how the blood-brain barrier and neural networks are formed to maintain CNS homeostasis and their contribution to neurodegeneration in diseased conditions. Another challenge is that some inhibitors produced by CNS injury do not facilitate the regenerating neural cells to incorporate into a pre-existing network. We review glial responses to CNS injury. Of note, the reactive astrocytes not only encompass the lesions/pathogens but may also form glial scars to impede regenerating axons from traversing the lesions. In addition, myelin debris can prevent axon growth. Myelination enables saltatory transduction of electrical impulses along axonal calibers and actually provides trophic support to stabilize the axons. Therefore, repair strategies should be designed to promote axonal growth, myelination and modulate astrocytic responses. Finally, we discuss recent progress in developing human monoclonal IgMs that regulate CNS homeostasis and promote neural regeneration."
Human iPSC for Therapeutic Approaches to the Nervous System: Present and Future Applications,"Cefalo MG, Carai A, Miele E, Po A, Ferretti E, Mastronuzzi A, Germano IM.","AB  - Many central nervous system (CNS) diseases including stroke, spinal cord injury (SCI), and brain tumors are a significant cause of worldwide morbidity/mortality and yet do not have satisfying treatments. Cell-based therapy to restore lost function or to carry new therapeutic genes is a promising new therapeutic approach, particularly after human iPSCs became available. However, efficient generation of footprint-free and xeno-free human iPSC is a prerequisite for their clinical use. In this paper, we will first summarize the current methodology to obtain footprint- and xeno-free human iPSC. We will then review the current iPSC applications in therapeutic approaches for CNS regeneration and their use as vectors to carry proapoptotic genes for brain tumors and review their applications for modelling of neurological diseases and formulating new therapeutic approaches. Available results will be summarized and compared. Finally, we will discuss current limitations precluding iPSC from being used on large scale for clinical applications and provide an overview of future areas of improvement. In conclusion, significant progress has occurred in deriving iPSC suitable for clinical use in the field of neurological diseases. Current efforts to overcome technical challenges, including reducing labour and cost, will hopefully expedite the integration of this technology in the clinical setting."
Regulating Axonal Responses to Injury: The Intersection between Signaling Pathways Involved in Axon Myelination and The Inhibition of Axon Regeneration,"Rao SN, Pearse DD.","AB  - Following spinal cord injury (SCI), a multitude of intrinsic and extrinsic factors adversely affect the gene programs that govern the expression of regeneration-associated genes (RAGs) and the production of a diversity of extracellular matrix molecules (ECM). Insufficient RAG expression in the injured neuron and the presence of inhibitory ECM at the lesion, leads to structural alterations in the axon that perturb the growth machinery, or form an extraneous barrier to axonal regeneration, respectively. Here, the role of myelin, both intact and debris, in antagonizing axon regeneration has been the focus of numerous investigations. These studies have employed antagonizing antibodies and knockout animals to examine how the growth cone of the re-growing axon responds to the presence of myelin and myelin-associated inhibitors (MAIs) within the lesion environment and caudal spinal cord. However, less attention has been placed on how the myelination of the axon after SCI, whether by endogenous glia or exogenously implanted glia, may alter axon regeneration. Here, we examine the intersection between intracellular signaling pathways in neurons and glia that are involved in axon myelination and axon growth, to provide greater insight into how interrogating this complex network of molecular interactions may lead to new therapeutics targeting SCI."
Olfactory ensheathing cells promote differentiation of neural stem cells and robust neurite extension,"Sethi R, Sethi R, Redmond A, Lavik E.","AB  - AIMS: The goal of this study was to gain insight into the signaling between olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) and neural stem cells (NSCs). We sought to understand the impact of OECs on NSC differentiation and neurite extension and to begin to elucidate the factors involved in these interactions to provide new targets for therapeutic interventions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We utilized lines of OECs that have been extremely well characterized in vitro and in vivo along with well studied NSCs in gels to determine the impact of the coculture in three dimensions. To further elucidate the signaling, we used conditioned media from the OECs as well as fractioned components on NSCs to determine the molecular weight range of the soluble factors that was most responsible for the NSC behavior. RESULTS: We found that the coculture of NSCs and OECs led to robust NSC differentiation and extremely long neural processes not usually seen with NSCs in three dimensional gels in vitro. Through culture of NSCs with fractioned OEC media, we determined that molecules larger than 30 kDa have the greatest impact on the NSC behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings suggest that cocultures of NSCs and OECs may be a novel combination therapy for neural injuries including spinal cord injury (SCI). Furthermore, we have identified a class of molecules which plays a substantial role in the behavior that provides new targets for investigating pharmacological therapies."
Epidermal neural crest stem cells (EPI-NCSC) and pluripotency,"Sieber-Blum M, Hu Y.","AB  - This article serves three purposes. We summarize current knowledge of the origin and characteristics of EPI-NCSC, review their application in a mouse model of spinal cord injury, and we present new data that highlight aspects of pluripotency of EPI-NCSC. EPI-NCSC are multipotent stem cells, which are derived from the embryonic neural crest and are located in the bulge of hair follicles. EPI-NCSC can undergo self-renewal and they are able to generate all major neural crest derivatives, including neurons, nerve supporting cells, smooth muscle cells, bone/cartilage cells and melanocytes. Despite their ectodermal origin, neural crest cells can also generate cell types that typically are derived from mesoderm. We were therefore interested in exploring aspects of EPI-NCSC pluripotency. We here show that EPI-NCSC can fuse with adult skeletal muscle fibers and that incorporated EPI-NCSC nuclei are functional. Furthermore, we show that adult skeletal muscle represents an environment conducive to long-term survival of neurogenic EPI-NCSC. Genes used to create induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells are present in our EPI-NCSC longSAGE gene expression library. Here we have corroborated this notion by real-time PCR. Our results show similarities in the expression of Myc, Klf4, Sox2 and Lin28 genes between EPI-NCSC and embryonic stem cells (ESC). In contrast there were major differences in Nanog and Pou5f1 (Oct-4) expression levels between EPI-NCSC and ESC, possibly explaining why EPI-NCSC are not tumorigenic. Overall, as embryonic remnants in an adult location EPI-NCSC show several attractive characteristics for future cell replacement therapy and/or biomedical engineering: Due to their ability to migrate, EPI-NCSC can be isolated as a highly pure population of multipotent stem cells by minimally-invasive procedures. The cells can be expanded in vitro into millions of stem cells/progenitors and they share some characteristics with pluripotent stem cells without being tumorigenic. Since the patients' own EPI-NCSC could be used for autologous transplantation, this would avoid graft rejection."
Nucleotides in neuroregeneration and neuroprotection,"Miras-Portugal MT, Gomez-Villafuertes R, Gualix J, Diaz-Hernandez JI, Artalejo AR, Ortega F, Delicado EG, Perez-Sen R.","AB  - Brain injury generates the release of a multitude of factors including extracellular nucleotides, which exhibit bi-functional properties and contribute to both detrimental actions in the acute phase and also protective and reparative actions in the later recovery phase to allow neuroregeneration. A promising strategy toward restoration of neuronal function is based on activation of endogenous adult neural stem/progenitor cells. The implication of purinergic signaling in stem cell biology, including regulation of proliferation, differentiation, and cell death has become evident in the last decade. In this regard, current strategies of acute transplantation of ependymal stem/progenitor cells after spinal cord injury restore altered expression of P2X4 and P2X7 receptors and improve functional locomotor recovery. The expression of both receptors is transcriptionally regulated by Sp1 factor, which plays a key role in the startup of the transcription machinery to induce regeneration-associated genes expression. Finally, general signaling pathways triggered by nucleotide receptors in neuronal populations converge on several intracellular kinases, such as PI3K/Akt, GSK3 and ERK1,2, as well as the Nrf-2/heme oxigenase-1 axis, which specifically link them to neuroprotection. In this regard, regulation of dual specificity protein phosphatases can become novel mechanism of actions for nucleotide receptors that associate them to cell homeostasis regulation. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'Purines in Neurodegeneration and Neuroregeneration'."
Alternatives to current disease-modifying treatment in MS: what do we need and what can we expect in the future?,"Kappos L, Kuhle J, Gass A, Achtnichts L, Radue EW.","AB  - Disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) for multiple sclerosis (MS) are now widely available, and their beneficial effects on relapse rates, magnetic resonance imaging outcomes and, in some cases, relapse-related disability have been shown in numerous clinical studies. However, as these treatments are only partially effective in halting the MS disease process, the search for improved treatment regimens and novel therapies must continue. Strategies to improve our therapeutic armamentarium have to take into account the different phases or parts of the pathogenesis of the disease. Available treatments address systemic immune dysfunction, blood-brain barrier permeability and the inflammatory process in the central nervous system. Currently, patients who fail to respond adequately to first-line DMTs are often considered as candidates for intensive immunosuppression with cytostatic agents or even autologous stem cell transplantation. However, new approaches are being developed. Combination therapies offer an alternative approach that may have considerable potential to improve therapeutic yield and, although likely to present considerable challenges in terms of trial design, this certainly seems to be a logical step forward in view of the complex pathology of MS. Several new drugs are also being developed with the aim of providing more effective, convenient and/or specific modulation of the inflammatory component of the disease. These treatments include humanised monoclonal antibodies such as the anti-VLA-4 antibody natalizumab, inhibitors of intracellular activation, signalling pathways and T-cell proliferation, and oral immunomodulators such as sirolimus, teriflunomide or statins. There remains, however, an urgent need for treatments that protect against demyelination and axonal loss, or promote remyelination/regeneration. Due to the chronicity of MS, the therapeutic window for neuroprotective agents is wider than that following stroke or acute spinal cord injury, and may therefore allow the use of some drugs that have proven disappointing in other situations. Novel potential neuroprotective agents such as alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid antagonists and ion-channel blockers will be entering Phase II trials in MS in the near future, and it is hoped that these agents will mark the start of a new era for DMTs for MS."
A scoping review of trials for cell-based therapies in human spinal cord injury,"Willison AG, Smith S, Davies BM, Kotter MRN, Barnett SC.","AB  - INTRODUCTION: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is associated with significant and life-long disability. Yet, despite decades of research, no regenerative treatment has reached clinical practice. Cell-based therapies are one possible regenerative strategy beginning to transfer to human trials from a more extensive pre-clinical basis. METHODS: We therefore conducted a scoping review to synthesise all cell-based trials in SCI to consider the current state of the field and the cell transplant type or strategy with greatest promise. A search strategy of MEDLINE returned 1513 results. All clinical trials including adult human patients with acute or chronic, compete or incomplete SCI and a recorded ASIA score were sought. Exclusion criteria included non-traumatic SCI, paediatric patients and animal studies. A total of 43 studies, treating 1061 patients, were identified. Most trials evaluated cells from the bone marrow (22 papers, 660 patients) or the olfactory bulb (10 papers, 245 patients). RESULTS: Cell transplantation does appear to be safe, with no serious adverse effects being reported in the short-term. 86% of trials described efficacy as a primary outcome. However, varying degrees of outcome reporting prevented meta-analysis. No emerging cell type or technique was identified. The majority of trials, 53%, took place in developing countries, which may suggest more stringent regulatory requirements within Western countries. CONCLUSION: We believe cell-based transplantation translation remains in its infancy and that, although further robust clinical research is required, it is an important strategy to consider in the treatment of SCI."
Major Differences in Transcriptional Alterations in Dorsal Root Ganglia Between Spinal Cord Injury and Peripheral Neuropathic Pain Models,"Cuevas-Diaz Duran R, Li Y, Garza Carbajal A, You Y, Dessauer CW, Wu J, Walters ET.","AB  - Chronic, often intractable, pain is caused by neuropathic conditions such as traumatic peripheral nerve injury (PNI) and spinal cord injury (SCI). These conditions are associated with alterations in gene and protein expression correlated with functional changes in somatosensory neurons having cell bodies in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs). Most studies of DRG transcriptional alterations have utilized PNI models where axotomy-induced changes important for neural regeneration may overshadow changes that drive neuropathic pain. Both PNI and SCI produce DRG neuron hyperexcitability linked to pain, but contusive SCI produces little peripheral axotomy or peripheral nerve inflammation. Thus, comparison of transcriptional signatures of DRGs across PNI and SCI models may highlight pain-associated transcriptional alterations in sensory ganglia that do not depend on peripheral axotomy or associated effects such as peripheral Wallerian degeneration. Data from our rat thoracic SCI experiments were combined with meta-analysis of published whole-DRG RNA-seq datasets from prominent rat PNI models. Striking differences were found between transcriptional responses to PNI and SCI, especially in regeneration-associated genes (RAGs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Many transcriptomic changes after SCI also were found after corresponding sham surgery, indicating they were caused by injury to surrounding tissue, including bone and muscle, rather than to the spinal cord itself. Another unexpected finding was of few transcriptomic similarities between rat neuropathic pain models and the only reported transcriptional analysis of human DRGs linked to neuropathic pain. These findings show that DRGs exhibit complex transcriptional responses to central and peripheral neural injury and associated tissue damage. Although only a few genes in DRG cells exhibited similar changes in expression across all the painful conditions examined here, these genes may represent a core set whose transcription in various DRG cell types is sensitive to significant bodily injury, and which may play a fundamental role in promoting neuropathic pain."
Exploring the role of non-coding RNAs in autophagy,"Ghafouri-Fard S, Shoorei H, Mohaqiq M, Majidpoor J, Moosavi MA, Taheri M.","AB  - As a self-degradative mechanism, macroautophagy/autophagy has a role in the maintenance of energy homeostasis during critical periods in the development of cells. It also controls cellular damage through the eradication of damaged proteins and organelles. This process is accomplished by tens of ATG (autophagy-related) proteins. Recent studies have shown the involvement of non-coding RNAs in the regulation of autophagy. These transcripts mostly modulate the expression of ATG genes. Both long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to modulate the autophagy mechanism. Levels of several lncRNAs and miRNAs are altered in this process. In the present review, we discuss the role of lncRNAs and miRNAs in the regulation of autophagy in diverse contexts such as cancer, deep vein thrombosis, spinal cord injury, diabetes and its complications, acute myocardial infarction, osteoarthritis, pre-eclampsia and epilepsy.Abbreviations: AMI: acute myocardial infarction; ATG: autophagy-related; lncRNA: long non-coding RNA; miRNA: microRNA."
Stem Cell and Obesity: Current State and Future Perspective,"Payab M, Goodarzi P, Foroughi Heravani N, Hadavandkhani M, Zarei Z, Falahzadeh K, Larijani B, Rahim F, Arjmand B.","AB  - Obesity as a worldwide growing challenge is determined by abnormal fat deposition, which may damage general health. Weight loss and control of related risk factors like type2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic syndrome is an important concern in obesity management. Different therapeutic approaches such as lifestyle change, medications, and surgery are introduced for obesity treatment. Despite of gaining partially desirable results, the problem is remained unsolved. Therefore, finding a new approach that can overcome previous limitations is very attractive for both researchers and clinicians. Cell-based therapy using adipose-derived stromal cells seems to be a promising strategy to control obesity and related syndromes. To attain this aim, understanding of different type of adipose tissues, main signaling pathways, and different factors involved in development of adipocyte is essential. Recently, several cell-based methods like stem cell administration, brown adipose tissue transplantation, cell lysates and exosomes have been examined on obese mouse models to manage obesity and related disorders. Successful outcome of such preclinical studies can encourage the cell-based clinical trials in the near future."
Endogenous reparative pluripotent Muse cells with a unique immune privilege system: Hint at a new strategy for controlling acute and chronic inflammation,"Kuroda Y, Oguma Y, Hall K, Dezawa M.","AB  - Multilineage-differentiating stress enduring (Muse) cells, non-tumorigenic endogenous pluripotent stem cells, reside in the bone marrow (BM), peripheral blood, and connective tissue as pluripotent surface marker SSEA-3(+) cells. They express other pluripotent markers, including Nanog, Oct3/4, and Sox2 at moderate levels, differentiate into triploblastic lineages, self-renew at a single cell level, and exhibit anti-inflammatory effects. Cultured mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and fibroblasts contain several percent of SSEA-3(+)-Muse cells. Circulating Muse cells, either endogenous or administered exogenously, selectively accumulate at the damaged site by sensing sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a key mediator of inflammation, produced by damaged cells and replace apoptotic and damaged cells by spontaneously differentiating into multiple cells types that comprise the tissue and repair the tissue. Thus, intravenous injection is the main route for Muse cell treatment, and surgical operation is not necessary. Furthermore, gene introduction or cytokine induction are not required for generating pluripotent or differentiated states prior to treatment. Notably, allogenic and xenogenic Muse cells escape host immune rejection after intravenous injection and survive in the tissue as functioning cells over 6 and ∼2 months, respectively, without immunosuppressant treatment. Since Muse cells survive in the host tissue for extended periods of time, therefore their anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and trophic effects are long-lasting. These unique characteristics have led to the administration of Muse cells via intravenous drip in clinical trials for stroke, acute myocardial infarction, epidermolysis bullosa, spinal cord injury, neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome without HLA-matching or immunosuppressive treatment."
Enhancing the Therapeutic Potential of Olfactory Ensheathing Cells in Spinal Cord Repair Using Neurotrophins,"Wright AA, Todorovic M, Tello-Velasquez J, Rayfield AJ, St John JA, Ekberg JA.","AB  - Autologous olfactory ensheathing cell (OEC) transplantation is a promising therapy for spinal cord injury; however, the efficacy varies between trials in both animals and humans. The main reason for this variability is that the purity and phenotype of the transplanted cells differs between studies. OECs are susceptible to modulation with neurotrophic factors, and thus, neurotrophins can be used to manipulate the transplanted cells into an optimal, consistent phenotype. OEC transplantation can be divided into 3 phases: (1) cell preparation, (2) cell administration, and (3) continuous support to the transplanted cells in situ. The ideal behaviour of OECs differs between these 3 phases; in the cell preparation phase, rapid cell expansion is desirable to decrease the time between damage and transplantation. In the cell administration phase, OEC survival and integration at the injury site, in particular migration into the glial scar, are the most critical factors, along with OEC-mediated phagocytosis of cellular debris. Finally, continuous support needs to be provided to the transplantation site to promote survival of both transplanted cells and endogenous cells within injury site and to promote long-term integration of the transplanted cells and angiogenesis. In this review, we define the 3 phases of OEC transplantation into the injured spinal cord and the optimal cell behaviors required for each phase. Optimising functional outcomes of OEC transplantation can be achieved by modulation of cell behaviours with neurotrophins. We identify the key growth factors that exhibit the strongest potential for optimizing the OEC phenotype required for each phase."
Meta-analysis of human and mouse ALS astrocytes reveals multi-omic signatures of inflammatory reactive states,"Ziff OJ, Clarke BE, Taha DM, Crerar H, Luscombe NM, Patani R.","AB  - Astrocytes contribute to motor neuron death in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but whether they adopt deleterious features consistent with inflammatory reactive states remains incompletely resolved. To identify inflammatory reactive features in ALS human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived astrocytes, we examined transcriptomics, proteomics, and glutamate uptake in VCP-mutant astrocytes. We complemented this by examining other ALS mutations and models using a systematic meta-analysis of all publicly-available ALS astrocyte sequencing data, which included hiPSC-derived astrocytes carrying SOD1, C9orf72, and FUS gene mutations as well as mouse ALS astrocyte models with SOD1(G93A) mutation, Tardbp deletion, and Tmem259 (also known as membralin) deletion. ALS astrocytes were characterized by up-regulation of genes involved in the extracellular matrix, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and the immune response and down-regulation of synaptic integrity, glutamate uptake, and other neuronal support processes. We identify activation of the TGFB, Wnt, and hypoxia signaling pathways in both hiPSC and mouse ALS astrocytes. ALS changes positively correlate with TNF, IL1A, and complement pathway component C1q-treated inflammatory reactive astrocytes, with significant overlap of differentially expressed genes. By contrasting ALS changes with models of protective reactive astrocytes, including middle cerebral artery occlusion and spinal cord injury, we uncover a cluster of genes changing in opposing directions, which may represent down-regulated homeostatic genes and up-regulated deleterious genes in ALS astrocytes. These observations indicate that ALS astrocytes augment inflammatory processes while concomitantly suppressing neuronal supporting mechanisms, thus resembling inflammatory reactive states and offering potential therapeutic targets."
MicroRNA: A new player in response to therapy for colorectal cancer,"Sarvizadeh M, Malekshahi ZV, Razi E, Sharifi H, Moussavi N, Taghizadeh M.","AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the important malignancies that result in cancer-related deaths worldwide. Multiple lines of evidence have indicated that different responses to therapy in CRC cells led to the failure of the current therapies. Hence, identification of the underlying cellular and molecular pathways involved in the emergence of different responses from CRC cells could contribute to finding and designing new therapeutic platforms to overcome the present limitations. Among the various targets involved in CRC pathogenesis, microRNAs (miRNAs) have key roles in many signaling pathways that are associated with the initiation and progression of CRC. Increasing evidence has confirmed that miRNAs as epigenetic regulators could play critical roles in the response (resistance or sensitivity) to therapy. Cancer stem cells are well-known players in resistance to therapy in CRC. They have been shown to play significant roles via inhibition and activation of many miRNA networks. Hence, miRNAs could be involved in the resistance and sensitivity of therapy in CRC cells via affecting different mechanisms, such as activation of cancer stem cells. Here, we summarized the role of various miRNAs in response to therapy of CRC cells. Moreover, we highlighted the roles of these molecules in the function of cancer stem cells, which are known as important players in the resistance to therapy in CRC."
Cell therapies for the central nervous system: how do we identify the best candidates?,"Noble M, Mayer-Pröschel M, Davies JE, Davies SJ, Pröschel C.","AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Central to the obstacles to be overcome in moving promising cell-based therapies from the laboratory to the clinic is that of determining which of the many cell types being examined are optimal for repairing particular lesions. RECENT FINDINGS: Our studies on astrocyte replacement therapies demonstrate clearly that some cells are far better than others at promoting recovery in spinal cord injury and that, at least in some cases, transplanting undifferentiated precursor cells is far less useful than transplanting specific astrocytes derived from those precursor cells. But further comparison between different approaches is hindered by the difficulties in replicating results between laboratories, even for well defined pharmacological agents and bioactive proteins. These difficulties in replication appear most likely to be due to unrecognized nuances in lesion characteristics and in the details of delivery of therapies. SUMMARY: We propose that the challenge of reproducibility provides a critical opportunity for refining cell-based therapies. If the utility of a particular approach is so restricted that even small changes in lesions or treatment protocols eliminate benefit, then the variability inherent in clinical injuries will frustrate translation. In contrast, rising to this challenge may enable discovery of refinements needed to confer the robustness needed for successful clinical trials."
Nanomaterials in Neural-Stem-Cell-Mediated Regenerative Medicine: Imaging and Treatment of Neurological Diseases,"Zhang B, Yan W, Zhu Y, Yang W, Le W, Chen B, Zhu R, Cheng L.","AB  - Patients are increasingly being diagnosed with neuropathic diseases, but are rarely cured because of the loss of neurons in damaged tissues. This situation creates an urgent clinical need to develop alternative treatment strategies for effective repair and regeneration of injured or diseased tissues. Neural stem cells (NSCs), highly pluripotent cells with the ability of self-renewal and potential for multidirectional differentiation, provide a promising solution to meet this demand. However, some serious challenges remaining to be addressed are the regulation of implanted NSCs, tracking their fate, monitoring their interaction with and responsiveness to the tissue environment, and evaluating their treatment efficacy. Nanomaterials have been envisioned as innovative components to further empower the field of NSC-based regenerative medicine, because their unique physicochemical characteristics provide unparalleled solutions to the imaging and treatment of diseases. By building on the advantages of nanomaterials, tremendous efforts have been devoted to facilitate research into the clinical translation of NSC-based therapy. Here, recent work on emerging nanomaterials is highlighted and their performance in the imaging and treatment of neurological diseases is evaluated, comparing the strengths and weaknesses of various imaging modalities currently used. The underlying mechanisms of therapeutic efficacy are discussed, and future research directions are suggested."
Role of Mitochondria in Neurodegenerative Diseases: From an Epigenetic Perspective,"Xu S, Zhang X, Liu C, Liu Q, Chai H, Luo Y, Li S.","AB  - Mitochondria, the centers of energy metabolism, have been shown to participate in epigenetic regulation of neurodegenerative diseases. Epigenetic modification of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins has an impact on mitochondria homeostasis, including mitochondrial biogenesis, and quality, which plays role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. On the other hand, intermediate metabolites regulated by mitochondria such as acetyl-CoA and NAD(+), in turn, may regulate nuclear epigenome as the substrate for acetylation and a cofactor of deacetylation, respectively. Thus, mitochondria are involved in epigenetic regulation through bidirectional communication between mitochondria and nuclear, which may provide a new strategy for neurodegenerative diseases treatment. In addition, emerging evidence has suggested that the abnormal modification of mitochondria DNA contributes to disease development through mitochondria dysfunction. In this review, we provide an overview of how mitochondria are involved in epigenetic regulation and discuss the mechanisms of mitochondria in regulation of neurodegenerative diseases from epigenetic perspective."
Molecular Tweezers: Supramolecular Hosts with Broad-Spectrum Biological Applications,"Shahpasand-Kroner H, Siddique I, Malik R, Linares GR, Ivanova MI, Ichida J, Weil T, Münch J, Sanchez-Garcia E, Klärner FG, Schrader T, Bitan G.","AB  - Lysine-selective molecular tweezers (MTs) are supramolecular host molecules displaying a remarkably broad spectrum of biologic activities. MTs act as inhibitors of the self-assembly and toxicity of amyloidogenic proteins using a unique mechanism. They destroy viral membranes and inhibit infection by enveloped viruses, such as HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, by mechanisms unrelated to their action on protein self-assembly. They also disrupt biofilm of Gram-positive bacteria. The efficacy and safety of MTs have been demonstrated in vitro, in cell culture, and in vivo, suggesting that these versatile compounds are attractive therapeutic candidates for various diseases, infections, and injuries. A lead compound called CLR01 has been shown to inhibit the aggregation of various amyloidogenic proteins, facilitate their clearance in vivo, prevent infection by multiple viruses, display potent anti-biofilm activity, and have a high safety margin in animal models. The inhibitory effect of CLR01 against amyloidogenic proteins is highly specific to abnormal self-assembly of amyloidogenic proteins with no disruption of normal mammalian biologic processes at the doses needed for inhibition. Therapeutic effects of CLR01 have been demonstrated in animal models of proteinopathies, lysosomal-storage diseases, and spinal-cord injury. Here we review the activity and mechanisms of action of these intriguing compounds and discuss future research directions. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Molecular tweezers are supramolecular host molecules with broad biological applications, including inhibition of abnormal protein aggregation, facilitation of lysosomal clearance of toxic aggregates, disruption of viral membranes, and interference of biofilm formation by Gram-positive bacteria. This review discusses the molecular and cellular mechanisms of action of the molecular tweezers, including the discovery of distinct mechanisms acting in vitro and in vivo, and the application of these compounds in multiple preclinical disease models."
Extracellular vesicle-loaded hydrogels for tissue repair and regeneration,"Ju Y, Hu Y, Yang P, Xie X, Fang B.","AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a collective term for nanoscale or microscale vesicles secreted by cells that play important biological roles. Mesenchymal stem cells are a class of cells with the potential for self-healing and multidirectional differentiation. In recent years, numerous studies have shown that EVs, especially those secreted by mesenchymal stem cells, can promote the repair and regeneration of various tissues and, thus, have significant potential in regenerative medicine. However, due to the rapid clearance capacity of the circulatory system, EVs are barely able to act persistently at specific sites for repair of target tissues. Hydrogels have good biocompatibility and loose and porous structural properties that allow them to serve as EV carriers, thereby prolonging the retention in certain specific areas and slowing the release of EVs. When EVs are needed to function at specific sites, the EV-loaded hydrogels can stand as an excellent approach. In this review, we first introduce the sources, roles, and extraction and characterization methods of EVs and describe their current application status. We then review the different types of hydrogels and discuss factors influencing their abilities to carry and release EVs. We summarize several strategies for loading EVs into hydrogels and characterizing EV-loaded hydrogels. Furthermore, we discuss application strategies for EV-loaded hydrogels and review their specific applications in tissue regeneration and repair. This article concludes with a summary of the current state of research on EV-loaded hydrogels and an outlook on future research directions, which we hope will provide promising ideas for researchers."
Systems biology discoveries using non-human primate pluripotent stem and germ cells: novel gene and genomic imprinting interactions as well as unique expression patterns,"Ben-Yehudah A, Easley CA 4th, Hermann BP, Castro C, Simerly C, Orwig KE, Mitalipov S, Schatten G.","AB  - Neurodegenerative disorders are a variety of diseases including Alzheimer's (AD), Parkinson's (PD), and Huntington's diseases (HD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) along with some other less common diseases generally described by the advanced deterioration of central or peripheral nervous system, structurally or functionally. In the last two decades, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) due to their unique assets encompassing self-renewal, multipotency and accessibility in association with low ethical concern open new frontiers in the context of neurodegenerative diseases therapy. Interestingly, MSCs can be differentiated into endodermal and ectodermal lineages (e.g., neurons, oligodendrocyte, and astrocyte), and thus could be employed to advance cell-based therapeutic strategy. Additionally, as inflammation ordinarily ensues as a local response provoked by microglia in the neurodegenerative diseases, MSCs therapy because of their pronounced immunomodulatory properties is noticed as a rational approach for their treatment. Recently, varied types of studies have been mostly carried out in vitro and rodent models using MSCs upon their procurement from various sources and expansion. The promising results of the studies in rodent models have motivated researchers to design and perform several clinical trials, with a speedily rising number. In the current review, we aim to deliver a brief overview of MSCs sources, expansion strategies, and their immunosuppressive characteristics and discuss credible functional mechanisms exerted by MSCs to treat neurodegenerative disorders, covering AD, PD, ALS, MS, and HD."
Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) for neurodegenerative disease: A promising frontier,"Shariati A, Nemati R, Sadeghipour Y, Yaghoubi Y, Baghbani R, Javidi K, Zamani M, Hassanzadeh A.","AB  - The study of pluripotent stem cells has generated much interest in both biology and medicine. Understanding the fundamentals of biological decisions, including what permits a cell to maintain pluripotency, that is, its ability to self-renew and thereby remain immortal, or to differentiate into multiple types of cells, is of profound importance. For clinical applications, pluripotent cells, including both embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells, have been proposed for cell replacement therapy for a number of human diseases and disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, spinal cord injury and diabetes. One challenge in their usage for such therapies is understanding the mechanisms that allow the maintenance of pluripotency and controlling the specific differentiation into required functional target cells. Because of regulatory restrictions and biological feasibilities, there are many crucial investigations that are just impossible to perform using pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) from humans (for example, direct comparisons among panels of inbred embryonic stem cells from prime embryos obtained from pedigreed and fertile donors; genomic analysis of parent versus progeny PSCs and their identical differentiated tissues; intraspecific chimera analyses for pluripotency testing; and so on). However, PSCs from nonhuman primates are being investigated to bridge these knowledge gaps between discoveries in mice and vital information necessary for appropriate clinical evaluations. In this review, we consider the mRNAs and novel genes with unique expression and imprinting patterns that were discovered using systems biology approaches with primate pluripotent stem and germ cells."
The 2020 Yearbook of Neurorestoratology,"Huang H, Chen L, Chopp M, Young W, Robert Bach J, He X, Sarnowaska A, Xue M, Chunhua Zhao R, Shetty A, Siniscalco D, Guo X, Khoshnevisan A, Hawamdeh Z.","AB  - COVID-19 has been an emerging and rapidly evolving risk to people of the world in 2020. Facing this dangerous situation, many colleagues in Neurorestoratology did their best to avoid infection if themselves and their patients, and continued their work in the research areas described in the 2020 Yearbook of Neurorestoratology. Neurorestorative achievements and progress during 2020 includes recent findings on the pathogenesis of neurological diseases, neurorestorative mechanisms and clinical therapeutic achievements. Therapeutic progress during this year included advances in cell therapies, neurostimulation/neuromodulation, brain-computer interface (BCI), and pharmaceutical neurorestorative therapies, which improved neurological functions and quality of life for patients. Four clinical guidelines or standards of Neurorestoratology were published in 2020. Milestone examples include: 1) a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of olfactory ensheathing cell treatment of chronic stroke showed functional improvements; 2) patients after transhumeral amputation experienced increased sensory acuity and had improved effectiveness in work and other activities of daily life using a prosthesis; 3) a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis used a steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based BCI to achieve accurate and speedy computer input; 4) a patient with complete chronic spinal cord injury recovered both motor function and touch sensation with a BCI and restored ability to detect objects by touch and several sensorimotor functions. We hope these achievements motivate and encourage other scientists and physicians to increase neurorestorative research and its therapeutic applications."

The rights and wrongs of blood-brain barrier permeability studies: a walk through 100 years of history,"Saunders NR, Dreifuss JJ, Dziegielewska KM, Johansson PA, Habgood MD, Møllgård K, Bauer HC.","AB  - Careful examination of relevant literature shows that many of the most cherished concepts of the blood-brain barrier are incorrect. These include an almost mythological belief in its immaturity that is unfortunately often equated with absence or at least leakiness in the embryo and fetus. The original concept of a blood-brain barrier is often attributed to Ehrlich; however, he did not accept that permeability of cerebral vessels was different from other organs. Goldmann is often credited with the first experiments showing dye (trypan blue) exclusion from the brain when injected systemically, but not when injected directly into it. Rarely cited are earlier experiments of Bouffard and of Franke who showed methylene blue and trypan red stained all tissues except the brain. The term blood-brain barrier"" ""Blut-Hirnschranke"" is often attributed to Lewandowsky"
The analgesic effects of botulinum neurotoxin by modulating pain-related receptors; A literature review,"Hosseindoost S, Askari Rad M, Inanloo SH, Rahimi M, Dehghan S, Orandi A, Dehpour AR, Majedi H.","AB  - Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs), produced by Clostridium botulinum, have been used for the treatment of various central and peripheral neurological conditions. Recent studies have suggested that BoNTs may also have a beneficial effect on pain conditions. It has been hypothesized that one of the mechanisms underlying BoNTs' analgesic effects is the inhibition of pain-related receptors' transmission to the neuronal cell membrane. BoNT application disrupts the integration of synaptic vesicles with the cellular membrane, which is responsible for transporting various receptors, including pain receptors such as TRP channels, calcium channels, sodium channels, purinergic receptors, neurokinin-1 receptors, and glutamate receptors. BoNT also modulates the opioidergic system and the GABAergic system, both of which are involved in the pain process. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these effects can provide valuable insights for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for pain management. This review aims to summarize the experimental evidence of the analgesic functions of BoNTs and discuss the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which they can act on pain conditions by inhibiting the transmission of pain-related receptors."
The Yin and Yang of Microglia-Derived Extracellular Vesicles in CNS Injury and Diseases,"Ghosh M, Pearse DD.","AB  - Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), play a crucial role in maintaining neural homeostasis but can also contribute to disease and injury when this state is disrupted or conversely play a pivotal role in neurorepair. One way that microglia exert their effects is through the secretion of small vesicles, microglia-derived exosomes (MGEVs). Exosomes facilitate intercellular communication through transported cargoes of proteins, lipids, RNA, and other bioactive molecules that can alter the behavior of the cells that internalize them. Under normal physiological conditions, MGEVs are essential to homeostasis, whereas the dysregulation of their production and/or alterations in their cargoes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), spinal cord injury (SCI), and traumatic brain injury (TBI). In contrast, MGEVs may also offer therapeutic potential by reversing inflammation or being amenable to engineering for the delivery of beneficial biologics or drugs. The effects of MGEVs are determined by the phenotypic state of the parent microglia. Exosomes from anti-inflammatory or pro-regenerative microglia support neurorepair and cell survival by delivering neurotrophic factors, anti-inflammatory mediators, and molecular chaperones. Further, MGEVs can also deliver components like mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and proteins to damaged neurons to enhance cellular metabolism and resilience. MGEVs derived from pro-inflammatory microglia can have detrimental effects on neural health. Their cargo often contains pro-inflammatory cytokines, molecules involved in oxidative stress, and neurotoxic proteins, which can exacerbate neuroinflammation, contribute to neuronal damage, and impair synaptic function, hindering neurorepair processes. The role of MGEVs in neurodegeneration and injury-whether beneficial or harmful-largely depends on how they modulate inflammation through the pro- and anti-inflammatory factors in their cargo, including cytokines and microRNAs. In addition, through the propagation of pathological proteins, such as amyloid-beta and alpha-synuclein, MGEVs can also contribute to disease progression in disorders such as AD and PD, or by the transfer of apoptotic or necrotic factors, they can induce neuron toxicity or trigger glial scarring during neurological injury. In this review, we have provided a comprehensive and up-to-date understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the multifaceted role of MGEVs in neurological injury and disease. In particular, the role that specific exosome cargoes play in various pathological conditions, either in disease progression or recovery, will be discussed. The therapeutic potential of MGEVs has been highlighted including potential engineering methodologies that have been employed to alter their cargoes or cell-selective targeting. Understanding the factors that influence the balance between beneficial and detrimental exosome signaling in the CNS is crucial for developing new therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases and neurotrauma."
Application of Bioactive Materials for Osteogenic Function in Bone Tissue Engineering,"Bai Y, Wang Z, He X, Zhu Y, Xu X, Yang H, Mei G, Chen S, Ma B, Zhu R.","AB  - Bone tissue defects present a major challenge in orthopedic surgery. Bone tissue engineering using multiple versatile bioactive materials is a potential strategy for bone-defect repair and regeneration. Due to their unique physicochemical and mechanical properties, biofunctional materials can enhance cellular adhesion, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation, thereby supporting and stimulating the formation of new bone tissue. 3D bioprinting and physical stimuli-responsive strategies have been employed in various studies on bone regeneration for the fabrication of desired multifunctional biomaterials with integrated bone tissue repair and regeneration properties. In this review, biomaterials applied to bone tissue engineering, emerging 3D bioprinting techniques, and physical stimuli-responsive strategies for the rational manufacturing of novel biomaterials with bone therapeutic and regenerative functions are summarized. Furthermore, the impact of biomaterials on the osteogenic differentiation of stem cells and the potential pathways associated with biomaterial-induced osteogenesis are discussed."

According to investigations, people with old age and underlying diseases are at higher risk of 2019 novel coronavirus infection. Indeed, they may show a severe form of the disease (with severe acute respiratory infections). Based on the promising role of cell therapy and regenerative medicine approaches in the treatment of several life-threatening diseases, it seems that applying cell-based approaches can also be a hopeful strategy for improving subjects with severe acute respiratory infections caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus.

Organisation of health services for preventing and treating pressure ulcers,"Joyce, P; Moore, ZEH; Christie, J","Abstract - Background Pressure ulcers, which are a localised injury to the skin, or underlying tissue, or both, occur when people are unable to reposition themselves to relieve pressure on bony prominences. Pressure ulcers are often difficult to heal, painful, expensive to manage and have a negative impact on quality of life. While individual patient safety and quality care stem largely from direct healthcare practitioner‐patient interactions, each practitioner‐patient wound‐care contact may be constrained or enhanced by healthcare organisation of services. Research is needed to demonstrate clearly the effect of different provider‐orientated approaches to pressure ulcer prevention and treatment. Objectives To assess the effects of different provider‐orientated interventions targeted at the organisation of health services, on the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers. Search methods In April 2018 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched three clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs, non‐RCTs, controlled before‐and‐after studies and interrupted time series, which enrolled people at risk of, or people with existing pressure ulcers, were eligible for inclusion in the review. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment, data extraction and GRADE assessment of the certainty of evidence. Main results The search yielded a total of 3172 citations and, following screening and application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we deemed four studies eligible for inclusion. These studies reported the primary outcome of pressure ulcer incidence or pressure ulcer healing, or both. One controlled before‐and‐after study explored the impact of transmural care (a care model that provided activities to support patients and their family/partners and activities to promote continuity of care), among 62 participants with spinal cord injury. It is unclear whether transmural care leads to a difference in pressure ulcer incidence compared with usual care (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 1.64; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded twice for very serious study limitations and twice for very serious imprecision). One RCT explored the impact of hospital‐in‐the‐home care, among 100 older adults. It is unclear whether hospital‐in‐the‐home care leads to a difference in pressure ulcer incidence risk compared with hospital admission (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.98; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded twice for very serious study limitations and twice for very serious imprecision). A third study (cluster‐randomised stepped‐wedge trial), explored the impact of being cared for by enhanced multidisciplinary teams (EMDT), among 161 long‐term‐care residents. The analyses of the primary outcome used measurements of 201 pressure ulcers from 119 residents. It is unclear if EMDT reduces the pressure ulcer incidence rate compared with usual care (hazard ratio (HR) 1.12, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.68; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded twice for very serious study limitations and twice for very serious imprecision). It is unclear whether there is a difference in the number of wounds healed (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.87; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded twice for very serious study limitations and twice for very serious imprecision). It is unclear whether there is a difference in the reduction in surface area, with and without EMDT, (healing rate 1.006; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.03; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded twice for very serious study limitations and twice for very serious imprecision). It is unclear if EMDT leads to a difference in time to complete healing (HR 1.48, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.78, very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded twice for very serious study limitations and twice for very serious imprecision). The final study (quasi‐experimental cluster trial), explored the impact of multidisciplinary wound care among 176 nursing home residents. It is unclear whether there is a difference in the number of pressure ulcers healed between multidisciplinary care, or usual care (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.42; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded twice for very serious study limitations and twice for very serious imprecision). It is unclear if this type of care leads to a difference in time to complete healing compared with usual care (HR 1.73, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.50; very low‐certainty evidence; downgraded twice for very serious study limitations and twice for very serious imprecision). In all studies the certainty of the evidence is very low due to high risk of bias and imprecision. We downgraded the evidence due to study limitations, which included selection and attrition bias, and sample size. Secondary outcomes, such as adverse events were not reported in all studies. Where they were reported it was unclear if there was a difference as the certainty of evidence was very low. Authors' conclusions Evidence for the impact of organisation of health services for preventing and treating pressure ulcers remains unclear. Overall, GRADE assessments of the evidence resulted in judgements of very low‐certainty evidence. The studies were at high risk of bias, and outcome measures were imprecise due to wide confidence intervals and small sample sizes, meaning that additional research is required to confirm these results. The secondary outcomes reported varied across the studies and some were not reported. We judged the evidence from those that were reported (including adverse events), to be of very low certainty. Plain language summary Organisation of health services for preventing and treating pressure ulcers What is the aim of this review? The aim of this review was to find out whether the way in which health services are organised can affect prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found four relevant studies. Key messages We cannot be certain whether transmural care (a way of providing care that delivers activities to support patients and their family/partners, and activities to promote continuity of care), hospital‐in‐the‐home care, care provided by a team of different disciplines or care that is usually provided, make any difference to whether people develop pressure ulcers, how fast existing ulcers heal, or whether people with ulcers are admitted or readmitted to hospital. What was studied in the review? Pressure ulcers, sometimes known as bedsores or pressure sores, are injuries that develop as a result of continued pressure on bony parts of the body such as the hips, heels or lower back. It is thought that the way health services are organised can influence the development of pressure ulcers among people at risk, and may also influence the healing of these wounds. Care can be delivered to people with pressure ulcers in various ways. We wanted to find out whether different types of care delivery affected the number of people developing pressure ulcers and how fast existing ulcers healed. What are the main results of the review? We found four studies dating from 1999 to 2014, that compared alternative types of care delivery to the way care is usually provided. The mean number of participants in the studies was 140, and the ages of participants ranged from 36.5 years to 83 years. In the studies 198 participants were men and 301 were women. All studies were funded by government agencies. Two studies focused on prevention of pressure ulcers, one on prevention and treatment, and one on treatment only. It is unclear whether any alternative type of care delivery is better than care that is usually provided at reducing risk of pressure ulcers, or improving pressure ulcer healing. It is also unclear whether the way healthcare services are organised improves quality of life, patient and staff satisfaction, reduces hospital admissions, emergency room visits, or death at 28 days. This is because we are very uncertain about the evidence in all studies. This Plain language summary is up to date as of 18 April 2018."
Time to publication for results of clinical trials,"Showell, MG; Cole, S; Clarke, MJ; DeVito, NJ; Farquhar, C; Jordan, V","Abstract - Background Researchers conducting trials have a responsibility to publish the results of their work in a peer‐reviewed journal, and failure to do so may introduce bias that affects the accuracy of available evidence. Moreover, failure to publish results constitutes research waste. Objectives To systematically review research reports that followed clinical trials from their inception and their investigated publication rates and time to publication. We also aimed to assess whether certain factors influenced publication and time to publication. Search methods We identified studies by searching MEDLINE, Embase, Epistemonikos, the Cochrane Methodology Register (CMR) and the database of the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), from inception to 23 August 2023. We also checked reference lists of relevant studies and contacted experts in the field for any additional studies. Selection criteria Studies were eligible if they tracked the publication of a cohort of clinical trials and contained analyses of any aspect of the publication rate or time to publication of these trials. Data collection and analysis Two review authors performed data extraction independently. We extracted data on the prevalence of publication and the time from the trial start date or completion date to publication. We also extracted data from the clinical trials included in the research reports, including country of the study's first author, area of health care, means by which the publication status of these trials were sought and the risk of bias in the trials. Main results A total of 204 research reports tracking 165,135 trials met the inclusion criteria. Just over half (53%) of these trials were published in full. The median time to publication was approximately 4.8 years from the enrolment of the first trial participant and 2.1 years from the trial completion date. Trials with positive results (i.e. statistically significant results favouring the experimental arm) were more likely to be published than those with negative or null results (OR 2.69, 95% CI 2.02 to 3.60; 19 studies), and they were published in a shorter time (adjusted HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.51 to 2.45; 4 studies). On average, trials with positive results took 2 years to publish, whereas trials with negative or null results took 2.6 years. Large trials were more likely to be published than smaller ones (adjusted OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.77; 11 studies), and they were published in a shorter time (adjusted HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.68; 7 studies). Multicentre trials were more likely to be published than single‐centre trials (adjusted OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.40; 2 studies). We found no difference between multicentre and single‐centre trials in time to publication. Trials funded by non‐industry sources (e.g.governments or universities) were more likely to be published than trials funded by industry (e.g. pharmaceutical companies or for‐profit organisations) (adjusted OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.82 to 2.49; 14 studies); they were also published in a shorter time (adjusted HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.86; 7 studies). Authors' conclusions Our updated review shows that trial publication is poor, with only half of all trials that are conducted being published. Factors that may make publication more likely and lead to faster publication are positive results, large sample size and being funded by non‐industry sources. Differences in publication rates result in publication bias and time‐lag bias that may influence findings and therefore ultimately affect treatment decisions. Systematic review authors should consider the possibility of time‐lag bias when conducting a systematic review, especially when updating their review. Funding This Cochrane review had no dedicated funding. Registration This review combines and updates two earlier Cochrane reviews. The two protocols and previous versions of the two updated reviews are available via 10.1002/14651858.MR000006 and 10.1002/14651858.MR000006.pub3 and 10.1002/14651858.MR000011 and 10.1002/14651858.MR000011.pub2. Plain language summary How long do clinical trials take to publish their results? What questions does this review address? How many of the clinical trials (studies) carried out to examine health interventions are published in journals, and how long does it take for these trials to be published? Are publication rates and the time taken to publication influenced by the nature of trial results, the number of participants and study centres, or the funding source for the trial? Key messages Nearly half (47%) of all clinical trials remain unpublished. Whether a trial is published and how long it takes is influenced by whether there are positive results, how large the trial is and if it is single‐ or multi‐centred, and which type of organisation has funded the trial. What are publication and publication bias? There are several steps in the publication of clinical trial results. The process begins with a clinical trial being carried out, then a summary document (manuscript) is written that contains the aims, methods and results of the trial. The manuscript is sent to a journal editor, then checked and commented on by the editor and colleagues, and by peer reviewers who are experts on the topic of the manuscript but were not involved in the trial. If they assess the manuscript as correct and suitable, it will be made available in an online or printed journal to be read by people with an interest in the findings. Sometimes, a subscription must be paid to access the manuscript, but often it will be 'open access', which means it is freely available. If the decision whether to publish a trial's results is influenced by the nature of those results, i.e. whether they are favourable to the intervention, this is referred to as 'publication bias'. Publication bias is a problem because it means that the information available to people making important health‐related decisions for themselves, their relatives or their patients is not complete and may even be misleading. For example, if negative results have not been published, there is a danger that the decision‐makers may not be aware of possible harms linked to the intervention. Publication bias in trials can be compounded in systematic reviews, which collect all the evidence on a topic. This is a concern as systematic reviews are heavily depended upon to make healthcare decisions and policies. Systematic reviews combine the results of multiple trials, allowing people to make decisions based on all available data, but if some trials cannot be included as they have not been published, the evidence is incomplete and may well be inaccurate. How can we avoid publication bias? The results of all clinical trials should be published, and the decision to publish should not be determined by the nature of the results or any other factors. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out how many trials are being published. We also wanted to find out whether publication and the time taken to publish are influenced by the nature of the results, the size of the trial and the type of organisation responsible for providing the money to run the trial. What did we do? We searched multiple health‐related databases to find studies that examined the publication rate or the time to publication of results of clinical trials. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on the study methods. What did we find? We found 204 studies, published between 1992 and 2023, which included 165,135 trials. The studies showed that just over half (53%) of all trials had published their results in a journal. The studies also showed that trials were more likely to be published if their results were positive, they were large (involving a lot of people), there were carried out in multiple places ('sites') and they were funded by a non‐commercial organisation. The time taken to publish was shorter for trials with positive results or a large sample size or if they were funded by a non‐commercial organisation. This evidence has important implications for when we should conduct systematic reviews and the best time to update them, especially if systematic reviews do not make efforts to include unpublished evidence. It is of particular concern for reviews containing only a small number of studies. What are the limitations of the evidence? The studies we included in this review varied in their methods, the type of trials they examined and their quality. In the review, we acknowledge and discuss these issues, and we provide separate analyses for trials of different types and quality. How up to date is this evidence? The evidence is based on searches carried out in August 2023."
Antibiotics and antiseptics for pressure ulcers,"Norman, G; Dumville, JC; Moore, ZEH; Tanner, J; Christie, J; Goto, S","Abstract - Background Pressure ulcers, also known as bedsores, decubitus ulcers and pressure injuries, are localised areas of injury to the skin or the underlying tissue, or both. A range of treatments with antimicrobial properties, including impregnated dressings, are widely used in the treatment of pressure ulcers. A clear and current overview is required to facilitate decision making regarding use of antiseptic or antibiotic therapies in the treatment of pressure ulcers. This review is one of a suite of Cochrane reviews investigating the use of antiseptics and antibiotics in different types of wounds. It also forms part of a suite of reviews investigating the use of different types of dressings and topical treatments in the treatment of pressure ulcers. Objectives To assess the effects of systemic and topical antibiotics, and topical antiseptics on the healing of infected and uninfected pressure ulcers being treated in any clinical setting. Search methods In October 2015 we searched: the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library ), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE (In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations), Ovid EMBASE, and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched three clinical trials registries and the references of included studies and relevant systematic reviews. There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication or study setting. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials which enrolled adults with pressure ulcers of stage II or above were included in the review. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Main results We included 12 trials (576 participants); 11 had two arms and one had three arms. All assessed topical agents, none looked at systemic antibiotics. The included trials assessed the following antimicrobial agents: povidone iodine, cadexomer iodine, gentian violet, lysozyme, silver dressings, honey, pine resin, polyhexanide, silver sulfadiazine, and nitrofurazone with ethoxy‐diaminoacridine. Comparators included a range of other dressings and ointments without antimicrobial properties and alternative antimicrobials. Each comparison had only one trial, participant numbers were low and follow‐up times short. The evidence varied from moderate to very low quality. Six trials reported the primary outcome of wound healing. All except one compared an antiseptic with a non‐antimicrobial comparator. There was some moderate and low quality evidence that fewer ulcers may heal in the short term when treated with povidone iodine compared with non‐antimicrobial alternatives (protease‐modulating dressings (risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.98) and hydrogel (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.97)); and no clear difference between povidone iodine and a third non‐antimicrobial treatment (hydrocolloid) (low quality evidence). Pine resin salve may heal more pressure ulcers than hydrocolloid (RR 2.83, 95% CI 1.14 to 7.05) (low quality evidence). There is no clear difference between cadexomer iodine and standard care, and between honey and a combined antiseptic and antibiotic treatment (very low quality evidence). Six trials reported adverse events (primary safety outcome). Four reported no adverse events; there was very low quality evidence from one showing no clear evidence of a difference between cadexomer iodine and standard care; in one trial it was not clear whether data were appropriately reported. There was limited reporting of secondary outcomes. The five trials that reported change in wound size as a continuous outcome did not report any clear evidence favouring any particular antiseptic/anti‐microbial treatments. For bacterial resistance, one trial found some evidence of more MRSA eradication in participants with ulcer treated with a polyhexanide dressing compared with a polyhexanide swab (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.13); patients in the dressing group also reported less pain (MD −2.03, 95% CI −2.66 to −1.40). There was no clear evidence of a difference between interventions in infection resolution in three other comparisons. Evidence for secondary outcomes varied from moderate to very low quality; where no GRADE assessment was possible we identified substantial limitations which an assessment would have taken into account. Authors' conclusions The relative effects of systemic and topical antimicrobial treatments on pressure ulcers are not clear. Where differences in wound healing were found, these sometimes favoured the comparator treatment without antimicrobial properties. The trials are small, clinically heterogenous, generally of short duration, and at high or unclear risk of bias. The quality of the evidence ranges from moderate to very low; evidence on all comparisons was subject to some limitations. Plain language summary Antibiotics and antiseptics for pressure ulcers What are pressure ulcers and who is at risk? Pressure ulcers, also known as bedsores, decubitus ulcers and pressure injuries, are wounds involving the skin and often the tissue that lies underneath. Pressure ulcers can be painful, may become infected, and affect people’s quality of life. People at risk of developing pressure ulcers include those with spinal cord injuries, and those who are immobile or have limited mobility, such as elderly people and people who are ill. Why use antiseptics and antibiotics to treat pressure ulcers? Where pressure ulcers are infected, antibiotics or antiseptics are used to kill or slow the growth of the micro‐organisms causing the infection and may prevent an infection from getting worse or spreading. This may also help the ulcer to heal. Where ulcers are not infected they usually still have populations of micro‐organisms present. It is thought that they may heal better if these are reduced by antimicrobial agents. However, the relationship between infection and micro‐organism populations in wounds and wound healing is not very clear. What we found In October 2015 we searched for as many studies as we could find that were randomised controlled trials and compared the use of an antibiotic or antiseptic with other treatments for pressure ulcers. We found 12 trials involving a total of 576 participants. Most study participants were older people in hospital. Most ulcers were not infected at the start of the trials. The different treatments assessed included povidone iodine, cadexomer iodine, gentian violet, lysozyme, silver dressings, honey, pine resin, silver sulfadiazine, polyhexanide and a combination of nitrofurazone and ethoxy‐diaminoacridine. Silver sulfadiazine and nitrofurazone are topical (locally acting) antibiotics while the other treatments are antiseptics. No trials looked at systemic (acting across the whole body) antibiotics. The treatments were compared with each other or to treatments without antimicrobial qualities. Most evidence on wound healing came from trials comparing antiseptics to treatments without antimicrobial qualities. There was no consistent evidence of a benefit to using any particular antimicrobial treatment for pressure ulcers. However, there was some limited evidence that more ulcers healed when treated with some types of alternative dressings without antimicrobial properties than when treated with povidone iodine. All the studies had low numbers of participants, and in some cases these numbers were very small. Many studies did not report important information about how they were carried out so it was difficult to tell whether the results presented were likely to be true. More, better quality, research is needed to determine the effects of antimicrobial treatments on pressure ulcers."
Immunity after COVID‐19 vaccination in people with higher risk of compromised immune status: a scoping review,"Kreuzberger, N; Hirsch, C; Andreas, M; Böhm, L; Bröckelmann, PJ; Di Cristanziano, V; Golinski, M; Hausinger, RIlona; Mellinghoff, S; Lange, B; Lischetzki, T; Kappler, V; Mikolajewska, A; Monsef, I; Park, YS; Piechotta, V; Schmaderer, C; Stegemann, M; Vanshylla, K; Weber, F; Weibel, S; Stephani, C; Skoetz, N","Abstract - Background High efficacy in terms of protection from severe COVID‐19 has been demonstrated for several SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccines. However, patients with compromised immune status develop a weaker and less stable immune response to vaccination. Strong immune response may not always translate into clinical benefit, therefore it is important to synthesise evidence on modified schemes and types of vaccination in these population subgroups for guiding health decisions. As the literature on COVID‐19 vaccines continues to expand, we aimed to scope the literature on multiple subgroups to subsequently decide on the most relevant research questions to be answered by systematic reviews. Objectives To provide an overview of the availability of existing literature on immune response and long‐term clinical outcomes after COVID‐19 vaccination, and to map this evidence according to the examined populations, specific vaccines, immunity parameters, and their way of determining relevant long‐term outcomes and the availability of mapping between immune reactivity and relevant outcomes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, the Web of Science Core Collection, and the World Health Organization COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease on 6 December 2021.  Selection criteria We included studies that published results on immunity outcomes after vaccination with BNT162b2, mRNA‐1273, AZD1222, Ad26.COV2.S, Sputnik V or Sputnik Light, BBIBP‐CorV, or CoronaVac on predefined vulnerable subgroups such as people with malignancies, transplant recipients, people undergoing renal replacement therapy, and people with immune disorders, as well as pregnant and breastfeeding women, and children. We included studies if they had at least 100 participants (not considering healthy control groups); we excluded case studies and case series. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently and in duplicate onto an online data extraction form. Data were represented as tables and as online maps to show the frequency of studies for each item. We mapped the data according to study design, country of participant origin, patient comorbidity subgroup, intervention, outcome domains (clinical, safety, immunogenicity), and outcomes.  Main results Out of 25,452 identified records, 318 studies with a total of more than 5 million participants met our eligibility criteria and were included in the review. Participants were recruited mainly from high‐income countries between January 2020 and 31 October 2021 (282/318); the majority of studies included adult participants (297/318).  Haematological malignancies were the most commonly examined comorbidity group (N = 54), followed by solid tumours (N = 47), dialysis (N = 48), kidney transplant (N = 43), and rheumatic diseases (N = 28, 17, and 15 for mixed diseases, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease, respectively). Thirty‐one studies included pregnant or breastfeeding women. The most commonly administered vaccine was BNT162b2 (N = 283), followed by mRNA‐1273 (N = 153), AZD1222 (N = 66), Ad26.COV2.S (N = 42), BBIBP‐CorV (N = 15), CoronaVac (N = 14), and Sputnik V (N = 5; no studies were identified for Sputnik Light). Most studies reported outcomes after regular vaccination scheme.  The majority of studies focused on immunogenicity outcomes, especially seroconversion based on binding antibody measurements and immunoglobulin G (IgG) titres (N = 179 and 175, respectively). Adverse events and serious adverse events were reported in 126 and 54 studies, whilst SARS‐CoV‐2 infection irrespective of severity was reported in 80 studies. Mortality due to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection was reported in 36 studies. Please refer to our  evidence gap maps  for more detailed information. Authors' conclusions Up to 6 December 2021, the majority of studies examined data on mRNA vaccines administered as standard vaccination schemes (two doses approximately four to eight weeks apart) that report on immunogenicity parameters or adverse events. Clinical outcomes were less commonly reported, and if so, were often reported as a secondary outcome observed in seroconversion or immunoglobulin titre studies. As informed by this scoping review, two effectiveness reviews (on haematological malignancies and kidney transplant recipients) are currently being conducted. Plain language summary Immunity in vulnerable groups after COVID‐19 vaccination What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out which studies on the most commonly used COVID‐19 vaccines in vulnerable subgroups have been published, and which outcomes were reported (e.g. effectiveness outcomes, safety, or immune response), to decide on the most relevant questions and answer these in further effectiveness systematic reviews (syntheses of the medical literature). What did we do? We searched medical databases and trial registries for studies on COVID‐19 vaccines that were authorised for use in the European Union (European Medicines Agency (EMA)‐approved) and those approved in at least 10 countries worldwide at the time of our search. We included studies on additional conditions (comorbidities) that can reduce the immune reaction to vaccination, if they had more than 100 participants; they could include any age, sex, ethnicity, or country of recruitment. We excluded studies looking at the general population and other than preselected COVID‐19 vaccines and subgroups.  Once we found the studies, we categorised the vaccines into the following groups: EMA‐approved COVID‐19 vaccines, other COVID‐19 vaccines, and schemes with different COVID‐19 vaccines. We summarised the results in an interactive online map. We mapped the study outcomes, the country in which the study was conducted, the study design, and the vulnerable population. What did we find? We included 318 studies. Most studies came from high‐income countries and included adults. We found that haematological malignancies (cancers that affect the blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes) and solid tumours were examined in many studies, followed by people receiving dialysis and kidney transplants, rheumatic diseases, and others. Thirty‐one studies included pregnant or breastfeeding women. The majority of studies explored mRNA vaccines (N = 283 and N = 153 for BNT162b2 and mRNA‐1273) at two doses, and EMA‐approved vaccines were more commonly administered than other vaccines and schemes with different COVID‐19 vaccines.  Outcomes related to immunogenicity (how well a vaccine works, or the ability to stimulate the development of antibodies), especially the presence or absence of antibodies in the blood of patients or an estimate for the amount of these antibodies, were the most frequently reported outcome in more than 170 studies each. In addition, adverse events were assessed often (N = 126 studies), whilst SARS‐CoV‐2 infection was reported in only 80 studies. What are the limitations of the evidence? Due to the quick development of the pandemic, the research landscape may have changed. The newer Omicron variant has become the dominant variant, and a new vaccine has been approved by the EMA, which is not covered by our search. How up‐to‐date is this evidence? The evidence is up‐to‐date to December 2021. What are the next steps? Based on the overview from this review, we have decided to conduct two detailed systematic reviews on haematological malignancies and kidney transplant recipients."
Pharmacological interventions other than botulinum toxin for spasticity after stroke,"Lindsay, C; Kouzouna, A; Simcox, C; Pandyan, AD","Abstract - Background The long‐term risk of stroke increases with age, and stroke is a common cause of disability in the community. Spasticity is considered a significantly disabling impairment that develops in people who have had a stroke. The burden of care is higher in stroke survivors who have spasticity when compared with stroke survivors without spasticity with regard to treatment costs, quality of life, and caregiver burden. Objectives To assess if pharmacological interventions for spasticity are more effective than no intervention, normal practice, or control at improving function following stroke. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (May 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2016, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1946 to May 2016), Embase (2008 to May 2016), CINAHL (1982 to May 2016), AMED (1985 to May 2016), and eight further databases and trial registers. In an effort to identify further studies, we undertook handsearches of reference lists and contacted study authors and commercial companies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared any systemically acting or locally acting drug versus placebo, control, or comparative drug with the aim of treating spasticity. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and extracted the data. We assessed the included studies for both quality and risk of bias. We contacted study authors to request further information when necessary. Main results We included seven RCTs with a total 403 participants. We found a high risk of bias in all but one RCT. Two of the seven RCTs assessed a systemic drug versus placebo. We pooled data on an indirect measure of spasticity (160 participants) from these two studies but found no significant effect (odds ratio (OR) 1.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 13.07; I 2  = 85%). We identified a significant risk of adverse events per participant occurring in the treatment group versus placebo group (risk ratio (RR) 1.65, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.42; 160 participants; I 2  = 0%). Only one of these studies used a functional outcome measure, and we found no significant difference between groups. Of the other five studies, two assessed a systemic drug versus another systemic drug, one assessed a systemic drug versus local drug, and the final two assessed a local drug versus another local drug. Authors' conclusions The lack of high‐quality RCTs limited our ability to make specific conclusions. Evidence is insufficient to determine if systemic antispasmodics are effective at improving function following stroke. Plain language summary Drugs (with the exception of botulinum toxin) to treat spasticity after stroke Question Are drugs (with the exception of botulinum toxin) better than a placebo or control in treating spasticity in people with stroke? Background We wanted to learn whether there was evidence for using drugs for spasticity in people with stroke, and if so, to identify whether drugs that acted on the whole body (systemic drugs) differed in their effects to drugs that acted in a localised area of the body (local drugs). Study characteristics We included seven studies involving a total of 403 participants. The evidence is current to May 2016. There were variations among the included studies. Two of the studies were placebo controlled, while the rest compared one drug to another drug. Two studies compared two systemic drugs against each other; two studies compared two local drugs against each other; and the fifth study compared a systemic drug against a local drug. Key results The results for the studies varied, meaning that we could make no clear conclusions. The two studies that used a placebo as a control provided conflicting results; when the results were combined we identified a slight benefit in favour of the treatment group. These two studies provided clear evidence that taking the treatment drug was likely to result in an increased risk of having an adverse event. This review identified a lack of studies and subsequent evidence relating to the use of pharmacological interventions (with the exception of botulinum toxin) to treat spasticity. Future research to identify the best time to start treatment and the optimal dose for treatment is recommended. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence varied. We judged all but one of the studies to be at high risk of bias in at least one of the six areas considered. The sample sizes in the included studies were relatively low for drug trials; three of the seven studies had 30 or fewer participants."
Repositioning for pressure injury prevention in adults,"Gillespie, BM; Walker, RM; Latimer, SL; Thalib, L; Whitty, JA; McInnes, E; Chaboyer, WP","Abstract - Background A pressure injury (PI), also referred to as a 'pressure ulcer', or 'bedsore', is an area of localised tissue damage caused by unrelieved pressure, friction, or shearing on any part of the body. Immobility is a major risk factor and manual repositioning a common prevention strategy. This is an update of a review first published in 2014. Objectives To assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of repositioning regimens(i.e. repositioning schedules and patient positions) on the prevention of PI in adults regardless of risk in any setting. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and EBSCO CINAHL Plus on 12 February 2019. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned the reference lists of included studies as well as reviews, meta‐analyses, and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication, or study setting. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster‐randomised trials (c‐RCTs), published or unpublished, that assessed the effects of any repositioning schedule or different patient positions and measured PI incidence in adults in any setting. Data collection and analysis Three review authors independently performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and data extraction. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Main results We identified five additional trials and one economic substudy in this update, resulting in the inclusion of a total of eight trials involving 3941 participants from acute and long‐term care settings and two economic substudies in the review. Six studies reported the proportion of participants developing PI of any stage. Two of the eight trials reported within‐trial cost evaluations. Follow‐up periods were short (24 hours to 21 days). All studies were at high risk of bias. Funding sources were reported in five trials. Primary outcomes: proportion of new PI of any stage Repositioning frequencies: three trials compared different repositioning frequencies We pooled data from three trials (1074 participants) comparing 2‐hourly with 4‐hourly repositioning frequencies (fixed‐effect; I² = 45%; pooled risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.41). It is uncertain whether 2‐hourly repositioning compared with 4‐hourly repositioning used in conjunction with any support surface increases or decreases the incidence of PI. The certainty of the evidence is very low due to high risk of bias, downgraded twice for risk of bias, and once for imprecision. One of these trials had three arms (967 participants) comparing 2‐hourly, 3‐hourly, and 4‐hourly repositioning regimens on high‐density mattresses; data for one comparison was included in the pooled analysis. Another comparison was based on 2‐hourly versus 3‐hourly repositioning. The RR for PI incidence was 4.06 (95% CI 0.87 to 18.98). The third study comparison was based on 3‐hourly versus 4‐hourly repositioning (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.92). The certainty of the evidence is low due to risk of bias and imprecision. In one c‐RCT, 262 participants in 32 ward clusters were randomised between 2‐hourly and 3‐hourly repositioning on standard mattresses and 4‐hourly and 6‐hourly repositioning on viscoelastic mattresses. The RR for PI with 2‐hourly repositioning compared with 3‐hourly repositioning on standard mattress is imprecise (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.16; very low‐certainty evidence). The CI for PI include both a large reduction and no difference for the comparison of 4‐hourly and 6‐hourly repositioning on viscoelastic foam (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.02). The certainty of the evidence is very low, downgraded twice due to high risk of bias, and once for imprecision. Positioning regimens: four trials compared different tilt positions We pooled data from two trials (252 participants) that compared a 30° tilt with a 90° tilt (random‐effects; I² = 69%). There was no clear difference in the incidence of stage 1 or 2 PI. The effect of tilt is uncertain because the certainty of evidence is very low (pooled RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.10 to 3.97), downgraded due to serious design limitations and very serious imprecision. One trial involving 120 participants compared 30° tilt and 45° tilt with 'usual care' and reported no occurrence of PI events (low certainty evidence). Another trial involving 116 ICU patients compared prone with the usual supine positioning for PI. Reporting was incomplete and this is low certainty evidence. Secondary outcomes No studies reported health‐related quality of life utility scores, procedural pain, or patient satisfaction. Cost analysis Two included trials also performed economic analyses. A cost‐minimisation analysis compared the costs of 3‐hourly and 4‐hourly repositioning with 2‐hourly repositioning schedule amongst nursing home residents. The cost of repositioning was estimated at CAD 11.05 and CAD 16.74 less per resident per day for the 3‐hourly or 4‐hourly regimen, respectively, compared with the 2‐hourly regimen. The estimates of economic benefit were driven mostly by the value of freed nursing time. The analysis assumed that 2‐, 3‐, or 4‐hourly repositioning is associated with a similar incidence of PI, as no difference in incidence was observed. A second study compared the nursing time cost of 3‐hourly repositioning using a 30° tilt with standard care (6‐hourly repositioning with a 90° lateral rotation) amongst nursing home residents. The intervention was reported to be cost‐saving compared with standard care (nursing time cost per patient EUR 206.60 versus EUR 253.10, incremental difference EUR −46.50, 95% CI EUR −1.25 to EUR −74.60). Authors' conclusions Despite the addition of five trials, the results of this update are consistent with our earlier review, with the evidence judged to be of low or very low certainty. There remains a lack of robust evaluations of repositioning frequency and positioning for PI prevention and uncertainty about their effectiveness. Since all comparisons were underpowered, there is a high level of uncertainty in the evidence base. Given the limited data from economic evaluations, it remains unclear whether repositioning every three hours using the 30° tilt versus ""usual care"" (90° tilt) or repositioning 3‐to‐4‐hourly versus 2‐hourly is less costly relative to nursing time. Plain language summary Repositioning to prevent pressure injuries What was the aim of this review? The aim of this review was to compare different positions and repositioning frequencies to find out which were the most effective in preventing pressure injuries in adults regardless of risk or healthcare setting. We collected and analysed all relevant studies (i.e. randomised controlled trials, a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method, and which provides the most reliable health evidence) to answer this question and found eight relevant trials and two economic evaluations. We found the effectiveness of repositioning frequencies to be unclear in the 2014 version of this review. This update includes the results of new trials conducted since that time. Key messages There is no clear evidence regarding which particular positions and repositioning frequencies are the most effective for preventing pressure injuries in adults. This is partly due to the low quality of the studies, most of which had small numbers of participants and were lacking in details about study methods. There is also limited evidence to support the cost‐effectiveness of different repositioning frequencies and positions. There is a need for further research to measure the effects of repositioning on pressure injury development and to find the best repositioning regimen relative to frequency and position. What was studied in this review? Pressure injuries, also called pressure ulcers, pressure sores, decubitus ulcers, and bedsores, are caused by pressure and rubbing on the bony weight‐bearing points of the body. A pressure injury is indicated by an area of localised damage to the skin or underlying tissue over a bony prominence. Pressure injuries occur most commonly in the elderly, or those who are immobile. Repositioning is one strategy used alongside other strategies to prevent the development of pressure injuries. Repositioning involves moving the person into a different position to redistribute pressure from a particular part of the body. We wanted to know which repositioning regimen was most effective in preventing pressure injuries in adults. We looked at the effect of different repositioning on peoples’ perceived satisfaction, pain, and quality of life. We were also interested in comparing the cost‐effectiveness of different repositioning approaches. What were the main results of this review? We identified eight clinical trials and two economic analyses published between 2004 and 2018 involving 3941 participants. Participant age ranged from 55 to 90 years. Three clinical trials compared repositioning frequencies using 2‐, 3‐, 4‐, or 6‐hourly repositioning. Three other trials compared different tilt positions. Two included trials also included cost‐effectiveness analyses. No studies reported health‐related quality of life, procedural pain, or patient satisfaction. The evidence to support the use of one particular repositioning frequency and position over another to prevent pressure injuries is low in quality and limited in amount, therefore which position or frequency of repositioning is the most effective in reducing pressure injury development is unclear. None of the included trials reported on participant pain, satisfaction, or quality of life. Results were inconclusive, and the certainty of the evidence in the included trials is low to very low. How up‐to‐date is this review? We searched for studies published up to February 2019."
Aquablation of the prostate for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia,"Hwang, EC; Jung, JH; Borofsky, M; Kim, MH; Dahm, P","Abstract - Background New, minimally invasive surgeries have emerged as alternatives to transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for the management of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Aquablation is a novel, minimally invasive, water‐based therapy, combining image guidance and robotics for the removal of prostatic tissue. Objectives To assess the effects of Aquablation for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Search methods We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases (the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and LILACS), trials registries, other sources of grey literature, and conference proceedings published up to 11 February 2019, with no restrictions on the language or status of publication. Selection criteria We included parallel‐group randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster‐RCTs, as well as non‐randomised observational prospective studies with concurrent comparison groups in which participants with BPH who underwent Aquablation. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion at each stage, and undertook data extraction and 'Risk of bias' and GRADE assessments of the certainty of the evidence. We considered review outcomes measured up to and including 12 months after randomisation as short‐term and beyond 12 months as long‐term. Main results We included one RCT with 184 participants comparing Aquablation to TURP. The mean age and International Prostate Symptom Score were 65.9 years and 22.6, respectively. The mean prostate volume was 53.2 mL. We only found short‐term data for all outcomes based on a single randomised trial. Primary outcomes Up to 12 months, Aquablation likely results in a similar improvement in urologic symptom scores to TURP (mean difference (MD) −0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) −2.51 to 2.39; participants = 174; moderate‐certainty evidence). We downgraded the evidence certainty by one level due to study limitations. Aquablation may also result in similar quality of life when compared to TURP (MD 0.27, 95% CI −0.24 to 0.78; participants = 174, low‐certainty evidence). We downgraded the evidence certainty by two levels due to study limitations and imprecision. Aquablation may result in little to no difference in major adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.26; participants = 181, very low‐certainty evidence) but we are very uncertain of this finding. This would correspond to 15 fewer major adverse events per 1000 participants (95% CI 64 fewer to 116 more). We downgraded the evidence certainty by one level for study limitations and two levels for imprecision. Secondary outcomes Up to 12 months, Aquablation may result in little to no difference in retreatments (RR 1.68, 95% CI 0.18 to 15.83; participants = 181, very low‐certainty evidence) but we are very uncertain of this finding. This would correspond to 10 more retreatments per 1000 participants (95% CI 13 fewer to 228 more). We downgraded the evidence certainty by one level due to study limitations and two levels for imprecision. Aquablation may result in little to no difference in erectile function as measured by International Index of Erectile Function questionnaire Erectile Function domain compared to TURP (MD 2.31, 95% CI −0.63 to 5.25; participants = 64, very low‐certainty evidence), and may cause slightly less ejaculatory dysfunction than TURP, as measured by Male Sexual Health Questionnaire for Ejaculatory Dysfunction (MD 2.57, 95% CI 0.60 to 4.53; participants = 121, very low‐certainty evidence). However, we are very uncertain of both findings. We downgraded the evidence certainty by two levels due to study limitations and one level for imprecision for both outcomes. We did not find other prospective, comparative studies comparing Aquablation to TURP or other procedures such as laser ablation, enucleation, or other minimally invasive therapies. Authors' conclusions Based on short‐term (up to 12 months) follow‐up, the effect of Aquablation on urological symptoms is probably similar to that of TURP (moderate‐certainty evidence). The effect on quality of life may also be similar (low‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain whether patients undergoing Aquablation are at higher or lower risk for major adverse events (very low‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain whether Aquablation may result in little to no difference in erectile function but offer a small improvement in preservation of ejaculatory function (both very low‐certainty evidence). These conclusions are based on a single study of men with a prostate volume up to 80 mL in size. Longer‐term data and comparisons with other modalities appear critical to a more thorough assessment of the role of Aquablation for the treatment of LUTS in men with BPH. Plain language summary Aquablation for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia Review question How does Aquablation compare to other procedures in patients with bothersome urinary symptoms caused by an enlarged prostate? Background An enlarged prostate may cause bothersome urinary tract symptoms, such as having to urinate often during the day or night, having a weak stream, and the feeling of not completely emptying the bladder. When lifestyle changes (like drinking less liquids) or medications do not help, men may choose to have surgery, such as a transurethral resection of the prostate. However, this procedure may cause unwanted effects, such as erection and ejaculation problems, or require retreatment. This review looks at the results of Aquablation, which is a newer treatment that uses high‐pressure water to remove prostate tissue and help with urinary tract symptoms. Study characteristics We looked for all studies that compared Aquablation to transurethral resection of the prostate. We included both studies in chance decided how men were treated and studies in which men and their urologist decided. We searched for studies up to 11 February 2019. Key results We found only one study in which chance decided how men were treated. The study compared Aquablation to transurethral resection of the prostate. On average, men were about 66 years old. We did not find any other studies. We found that Aquablation likely improves urinary symptoms similarly to transurethral resection of the prostate and may also lead to similar quality of life. Rates of unwanted serious effects may also be similar but we are very uncertain about this. Men who have Aquablation may have a similar risk of needing a repeat procedure as those having transurethral resection of the prostate but we are very uncertain of this finding. Aquablation may make little to no difference to erectile function but may have fewer issues with ejaculation, but we are very uncertain of both findings. These findings are based on a single study funded by the company that makes the device used for Aquablation. All data were limited to 12 months' follow‐up or less and prostate size was less than or equal to 80 mL. Certainty of the evidence Our certainty about the evidence we found ranged from moderate to very low due to shortcomings in how the study was done and small study size. This means that we have either moderate, limited or very little confidence in the results, depending on the outcome."
Sacral nerve stimulation for faecal incontinence and constipation in adults,"Thaha, MA; Abukar, AA; Thin, NN; Ramsanahie, A; Knowles, CH","Abstract - Background Faecal incontinence (FI) and constipation are both socially‐embarrassing and physically‐disabling conditions that impair quality of life. For both, surgery may be required in a minority of people when more conservative measures fail. However, the invasiveness and irreversible nature of direct surgery on bowel and sphincter muscles, poor long‐term outcomes and well‐established compIications makes such procedures unappealing for these benign conditions. A less‐invasive surgical option to treat faecal incontinence and constipation is direct, low‐voltage stimulation of the sacral nerve roots, termed sacral nerve stimulation (SNS). SNS has become the first line surgical treatment for FI in people failing conservative therapies. Its value in the treatment of constipation is less clear. Objectives To assess the effects of sacral nerve stimulation using implanted electrodes for the treatment of faecal incontinence and constipation in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In‐Process, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) ICTRP and handsearched journals and conference proceedings (searched 5 February 2015), EMBASE (1 January 1947 to 2015 Week 5), and the reference lists of retrieved relevant articles. Selection criteria All randomised or quasi‐randomised trials assessing the effects of SNS for faecal incontinence or constipation in adults. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the search results, assessed the methodological quality of the included trials, and undertook data extraction. Main results Six crossover trials and two parallel group trials were included. Six trials assessed the effects of SNS for FI. In the parallel group trial conducted by Tjandra, 53 participants with severe FI in the SNS group experienced fewer episodes of faecal incontinence compared to the control group who received optimal medical therapy (mean difference (MD) −5.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) −9.15 to −1.25 at 3 months; MD −6.30, 95% CI −10.34 to −2.26 at 12 months). Adverse events were reported in a proportion of participants: pain at implant site (6%), seroma (2%) and excessive tingling in the vaginal region (9%). In the parallel group trial carried out by Thin, 15 participants with FI in the SNS group experienced fewer episodes of FI compared with the percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) group (MD −3.00, 95% CI −6.61 to 0.61 at 3 months; MD −3.20, 95% CI −7.14 to 0.74 at 12 months). Adverse events were reported in three participants: mild ipsilateral leg pain during temporary testing (n = 1); and stimulator‐site pain following insertion of neurostimulator (n = 2). In the crossover trial by Leroi 7 of 34 recruited participants were excluded from the crossover due mainly to complications or immediate device failure. Twenty‐four of the remaining 27 participants while still blinded chose the period of stimulation they had preferred. Outcomes were reported separately for 19 participants who preferred the 'on' and five who preferred the 'off' period. For the group of 19, the median (range) episodes of faecal incontinence per week fell from 1.7 (0 to 9) during the 'off' period to 0.7 (0 to 5) during the 'on' period; for the group of five, however, the median (range) rose from 1.7 (0 to 11) during the 'off' period compared with 3.7 (0 to 11) during the 'on' period. Four of 27 participants experienced an adverse event resulting in removal of the stimulator. In the crossover trial by Sørensen and colleagues, participants did not experience any FI episodes in either the one‐week ‘on’ or ‘off’ periods. In the crossover trial by Vaizey, participants reported an average of six, and one, episodes of faecal incontinence per week during the 'off' and 'on' periods respectively in two participants with FI. Neither study reported adverse events. In the crossover trial by Kahlke, 14 participants with FI experienced significantly lower episodes of FI per week during the stimulator 'on' (1 (SD, 1.7)) compared with the 'off' period (8.4 (SD, 8.7)). Adverse events reported include: haematoma formation (n = 3); misplacement of tined lead (1); and pain at stimulator site (n = 1). Two trials assessed SNS for constipation. In the Kenefick trial, the two participants experienced an average of two bowel movements per week during the 'off' crossover period, compared with five during the 'on' period. Abdominal pain and bloating occurred 79% of the time during the 'off' period compared with 33% during the 'on' period. No adverse events occurred. In contrast, in the trial by Dinning with 59 participants, SNS did not improve frequency of bowel movements and 73 adverse events were reported, which included pain at site of the implanted pulse generator (32), wound infection (12), and urological (17) events. Authors' conclusions The limited evidence from the included trials suggests that SNS can improve continence in a proportion of patients with faecal incontinence. However, SNS did not improve symptoms in patients with constipation. In addition, adverse events occurred in some patients where these were reported. Rigorous high quality randomised trials are needed to allow the effects of SNS for these conditions to be assessed with more certainty. Plain language summary Sacral nerve stimulation for treating faecal incontinence and constipation in adults Importance of the review/Background:  Faecal incontinence occurs when a person passes stools without the usual control. Constipation is harder to define but generally describes a situation in which a person feels that their bowel opening is unsatisfactory (usually a combination of difficulty or infrequency of passing stools). Both conditions can severely affect people's quality of life. There are many non‐surgical treatments for both conditions but occasionally surgery is required when other options fail. Sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) is a relatively new treatment for these conditions. It involves implanting a battery‐powered stimulator unit in the buttock. This is connected to electrodes which rest on the nerves in the lower spine. The stimulator then continuously sends impulses to the nerves and muscles that control the bowel and anus. Initially, a temporary electrode lead is connected to a portable battery unit outside the body. If symptoms are improved enough, this is replaced by the implanted battery. Main findings:  This review evaluated the published evidence for the use of SNS for patients with faecal incontinence or constipation from six trials of SNS for faecal incontinence (219 participants) and two trials of SNS for constipation (61 participants). Two of the faecal incontinence trials had a 'parallel group design', which means that one group of participants received SNS and the other control group did not receive SNS throughout the trial. The remaining six trials had a 'crossover design', in which the participants experienced equal periods with stimulation 'off' then 'on', or vice versa. The level of stimulation was such that participants could not tell whether the system was 'on' or 'off'. SNS for faecal incontinence:  In the two 'parallel group' trials, 53 and 15 participants with faecal incontinence who were in the SNS group experienced fewer episodes of faecal incontinence compared to the control group at 3 and 12 months. In the first crossover trial, 24 participants who completed the trial chose the period of stimulation they had preferred while still unaware whether this was 'on' or 'off'. Nineteen participants who preferred the 'on' period experienced 59% fewer episodes of FI per week during the 'on' period, and 5 participants who preferred the 'off' period experienced 118% more episodes of FI per week. In the second crossover trial, the participants did not experience episodes of FI during either the 'on' or the 'off' periods. In the third trial, participants experienced 83% fewer episodes of faecal incontinence during the 'on' compared with the 'off' period. In the fourth crossover trial participants experienced 88% fewer episodes of faecal incontinence during the 'on' period compared with the 'off' period. SNS for faecal incontinence — adverse effects:  Not all trials reported adverse effects after SNS. The two 'parallel group' trials reported only minor complications, in 10% of SNS participants in the first study, and in 3 participants in the second study. In the first crossover study 7 out of 34 participants were excluded from crossover due mainly to complications. Four out of 27 participants with an implanted system in this study experienced a problem that led to the device being removed. The participants in the fourth crossover trial experienced some complications with the SNS implanted electrode such as pain (one person), misplacement of the tined lead (one person) and haematoma (swelling containing blood) (three people). SNS for constipation:  In one trial assessing SNS for constipation, two participants reported an increase of 150% in the frequency of passing stools per week, and time with abdominal pain and swelling went down from 79% during the 'off' period to 33% during the 'on' period. However, in the much larger second trial assessing SNS for constipation, in 59 participants SNS did not improve frequency of bowel movements. Limitations of the review:  The limited evidence suggests that SNS can improve continence in some people with faecal incontinence. SNS did not improve symptoms in patients with constipation. Larger, good‐quality trials are needed to provide more reliable evidence on the effectiveness of SNS for these two conditions."
Massage for neck pain,"Gross, AR; Lee, H; Ezzo, J; Chacko, N; Gelley, G; Forget, M; Morien, A; Graham, N; Santaguida, PL; Rice, M; Dixon, C","Abstract - Background Massage is widely used for neck pain, but its effectiveness remains unclear. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of massage compared to placebo or sham, no treatment or exercise as an adjuvant to the same co‐intervention for acute to chronic persisting neck pain in adults with or without radiculopathy, including whiplash‐associated disorders and cervicogenic headache. Search methods We searched multiple databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Index to Chiropractic Literature, trial registries) to 1 October 2023. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any type of massage with sham or placebo, no treatment or wait‐list, or massage as an adjuvant treatment, in adults with acute, subacute or chronic neck pain. Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We transformed outcomes to standardise the direction of the effect (a smaller score is better). We used a partially contextualised approach relative to identified thresholds to report the effect size as slight‐small, moderate or large‐substantive. Main results We included 33 studies (1994 participants analysed). Selection (82%) and detection bias (94%) were common; multiple trials had unclear allocation concealment, utilised a placebo that may not be credible and did not test whether blinding to the placebo was effective. Massage was compared with placebo (n = 10) or no treatment (n = 8), or assessed as an adjuvant to the same co‐treatment (n = 15). The trials studied adults aged 18 to 70 years, 70% female, with mean pain severity of 51.8 (standard deviation (SD) 14.1) on a visual analogue scale (0 to 100). Neck pain was subacute‐chronic and classified as non‐specific neck pain (85%, including n = 1 whiplash), radiculopathy (6%) or cervicogenic headache (9%). Trials were conducted in outpatient settings in Asia (n = 11), America (n = 5), Africa (n = 1), Europe (n = 12) and the Middle East (n = 4). Trials received research funding (15%) from research institutes. We report the main results for the comparison of massage versus placebo. Low‐certainty evidence indicates that massage probably results in little to no difference in pain, function‐disability and health‐related quality of life when compared against a placebo for subacute‐chronic neck pain at up to 12 weeks follow‐up. It may slightly improve participant‐reported treatment success. Subgroup analysis by dose showed a clinically important difference favouring a high dose (≥ 8 sessions over four weeks for ≥ 30 minutes duration). There is very low‐certainty evidence for total adverse events. Data on patient satisfaction and serious adverse events were not available. Pain was a mean of 20.55 points with placebo and improved by 3.43 points with massage (95% confidence interval (CI) 8.16 better to 1.29 worse) on a 0 to 100 scale, where a lower score indicates less pain (8 studies, 403 participants; I 2  = 39%). We downgraded the evidence to low‐certainty due to indirectness; most trials in the placebo comparison used suboptimal massage doses (only single sessions). Selection, performance and detection bias were evident as multiple trials had unclear allocation concealment, utilised a placebo that may not be credible and did not test whether blinding was effective, respectively. Function‐disability was a mean of 30.90 points with placebo and improved by 9.69 points with massage (95% CI 17.57 better to 1.81 better) on the Neck Disability Index 0 to 100, where a lower score indicates better function (2 studies, 68 participants; I 2  = 0%). We downgraded the evidence to low‐certainty due to imprecision (the wide CI represents slight to moderate benefit that does not rule in or rule out a clinically important change) and risk of selection, performance and detection biases. Participant‐reported treatment success was a mean of 3.1 points with placebo and improved by 0.80 points with massage (95% CI 1.39 better to 0.21 better) on a Global Improvement 1 to 7 scale, where a lower score indicates very much improved (1 study, 54 participants). We downgraded the evidence to low‐certainty due to imprecision (single study with a wide CI that does not rule in or rule out a clinically important change) and risk of performance as well as detection bias. Health‐related quality of life was a mean of 43.2 points with placebo and improved by 5.30 points with massage (95% CI 8.24 better to 2.36 better) on the SF‐12 (physical) 0 to 100 scale, where 0 indicates the lowest level of health (1 study, 54 participants). We downgraded the evidence once for imprecision (a single small study) and risk of performance and detection bias. We are uncertain whether massage results in increased total adverse events, such as treatment soreness, sweating or low blood pressure (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.08 to 11.55; 2 studies, 175 participants; I 2  = 77%). We downgraded the evidence to very low‐certainty due to unexplained inconsistency, risk of performance and detection bias, and imprecision (the CI was extremely wide and the total number of events was very small, i.e < 200 events). Authors' conclusions The contribution of massage to the management of neck pain remains uncertain given the predominance of low‐certainty evidence in this field. For subacute and chronic neck pain (closest to 12 weeks follow‐up), massage may result in a little or no difference in improving pain, function‐disability, health‐related quality of life and participant‐reported treatment success when compared to a placebo. Inadequate reporting on adverse events precluded analysis. Focused planning for larger, adequately dosed, well‐designed trials is needed. Plain language summary Massage for neck pain Key message This review shows that in subacute (medium‐term) or persisting neck pain, at closest to 12 weeks follow‐up, massage compared to a 'dummy' massage probably results in little to no difference in pain, function‐disability, quality of life and participant‐reported treatment success. Possible side effects may include treatment soreness. Background Neck pain is a common condition in adults leading to acute (< 4 weeks), subacute (4 to 12 weeks) or persisting (>12 weeks) neck pain, disability and substantial economic costs. It may lead to headaches stemming from the neck, referral of pain into the upper back and arms, and signs of weakness or numbness in the arms. It can be affected by bones, joints, muscles, ligaments, tendons and nerves, and be influenced by social, psychological and personal factors. Massage therapy involves the movement of the soft tissues of the body through manual touch to reduce pain and muscle tension, and promote relaxation. Because massage therapy is commonly used, inexpensive and has minimal side effects, it is of great interest to people with neck pain. What did we want to find out? What are the benefits and risks of massage for treating acute, subacute and chronic persisting neck pain in adults with or without arm pain and headache or associated with a whiplash injury? Does the dose (frequency per week, total number of weeks, session duration) of massage influence findings? What did we find? We found 33 studies that involved 1994 people suffering subacute and persisting moderate to very strong neck pain including arm pain (6%), whiplash (3%) or headache stemming from the neck (9%). There were no studies addressing acute pain. Studies examined adults aged 18 to 70 years, who were mostly female (70%). Trials were conducted in outpatient settings in Asia, America, Africa, Europe and the Middle East. Funding, when reported (in 15% of studies), was from research centres or universities. We included studies evaluating many massage techniques (with ischaemic compression, a sustained pressure over the soft tissue, being the most common technique) that vary in the manner in which touch is applied, the amount of pressure and intensity that is applied, and session frequency. We did not include techniques that used a massage tool to deliver treatment or non‐touch energy techniques. Compared with a 'dummy' massage treatment, massage probably results in little to no difference in the following: •  Pain  (3% improvement): People who had a 'dummy' massage rated their pain at 20.55 points while people who had massage rated their post‐treatment pain as 17.12 points. Those who used massage improved by 3.43 points (8.16 better to 1.29 worse) on a 0‐ to 100‐point scale, where a lower score means less pain. •  Function‐disability  (10% improvement): People who had a 'dummy' massage rated their function‐disability at 30.9 points. People who had massage rated their post‐treatment function‐disability as 21.21 points. Those who used massage improved by 9.69 points (17.57 better to 1.81 better) on a 0‐ to 100‐point scale, where a lower score means better function‐disability. •  Participant‐reported treatment success  (11% improvement): People who had a 'dummy' massage rated their self‐reported treatment success at 3.1 points. People who had massage treatment rated their post‐treatment success as 2.3 points. Those who used massage improved by 0.80 points (1.39 better to 0.21 better) on a 1‐ to 7‐point scale, where a lower score means more self‐reported treatment success. •  Health‐related quality of life  (5% improvement): People who had a 'dummy' massage rated their quality of life at 43.2 points. People who had massage rated their post‐treatment quality of life as 48.5 points. Those who used massage improved by 5.30 points (8.24 better to 2.36 better) on a 0‐ to 100‐point scale, where a higher score means better quality of life. •  Patient satisfaction and serious adverse events  ‐ these outcomes were not reported. •  Minor adverse events  ‐ minor adverse (unwanted or harmful) events were poorly reported, were the same as with the dummy massage and included minor temporary effects such as mild treatment soreness. What are the limitations of the evidence? We have little confidence in our findings that massage provides little to no benefit in terms of pain, function‐disability, quality of life and participant‐reported treatment success compared to a 'dummy' massage, because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. We believe that these biases may result in either an over or underestimation of the size of the effect reported. The occurrence of adverse events was not commonly reported. The number of participants in most trials was small. Focused planning of studies with larger numbers of participants, adequate massage doses and control for study biases is needed. How up‐to‐date is this evidence? We searched databases up to 1 October 2023."
Foam dressings for treating pressure ulcers,"Walker, RM; Gillespie, BM; Thalib, L; Higgins, NS; Whitty, JA","Abstract - Background Pressure ulcers, also known as pressure injuries and bed sores, are localised areas of injury to the skin or underlying tissues, or both. Dressings made from a variety of materials, including foam, are used to treat pressure ulcers. An evidence‐based overview of dressings for pressure ulcers is needed to enable informed decision‐making on dressing use. This review is part of a suite of Cochrane Reviews investigating the use of dressings in the treatment of pressure ulcers. Each review will focus on a particular dressing type. Objectives To assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of foam wound dressings for healing pressure ulcers in people with an existing pressure ulcer in any care setting. Search methods In February 2017 we searched: the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase; EBSCO CINAHL Plus and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED). We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. Selection criteria Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster‐RCTs, that compared the clinical and cost effectiveness of foam wound dressings for healing pressure ulcers (Category/Stage II or above). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias and data extraction. A third reviewer resolved discrepancies between the review authors. Main results We included nine trials with a total of 483 participants, all of whom were adults (59 years or older) with an existing pressure ulcer Category/Stage II or above. All trials had two arms, which compared foam dressings with other dressings for treating pressure ulcers. The certainty of evidence ranged from low to very low due to various combinations of selection, performance, attrition, detection and reporting bias, and imprecision due to small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals. We had very little confidence in the estimate of effect of included studies. Where a foam dressing was compared with another foam dressing, we established that the true effect was likely to be substantially less than the study's estimated effect. We present data for four comparisons. One trial compared a silicone foam dressing with another (hydropolymer) foam dressing (38 participants), with an eight‐week (short‐term) follow‐up. It was uncertain whether alternate types of foam dressing affected the incidence of healed pressure ulcers (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.75) or adverse events (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.25), as the certainty of evidence was very low, downgraded for serious limitations in study design and very serious imprecision. Four trials with a median sample size of 20 participants (230 participants), compared foam dressings with hydrocolloid dressings for eight weeks or less (short‐term). It was uncertain whether foam dressings affected the probability of healing in comparison to hydrocolloid dressings over a short follow‐up period in three trials (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.34), very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded for very serious study limitations and serious imprecision. It was uncertain if there was a difference in risk of adverse events between groups (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.11), very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded for serious study limitations and very serious imprecision. Reduction in ulcer size, patient satisfaction/acceptability, pain and cost effectiveness data were also reported but we assessed the evidence as being of very low certainty. One trial (34 participants), compared foam and hydrogel dressings over an eight‐week (short‐term) follow‐up. It was uncertain if the foam dressing affected the probability of healing (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.28), time to complete healing (MD 5.67 days 95% CI ‐4.03 to 15.37), adverse events (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.65) or reduction in ulcer size (MD 0.30 cm 2  per day, 95% CI ‐0.15 to 0.75), as the certainty of the evidence was very low, downgraded for serious study limitations and very serious imprecision. The remaining three trials (181 participants) compared foam with basic wound contact dressings. Follow‐up times ranged from short‐term (8 weeks or less) to medium‐term (8 to 24 weeks). It was uncertain whether foam dressings affected the probability of healing compared with basic wound contact dressings, in the short term (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.88) or medium term (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.72), or affected time to complete healing in the medium term (MD ‐35.80 days, 95% CI ‐56.77 to ‐14.83), or adverse events in the medium term (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.05). This was due to the very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded for serious to very serious study limitations and imprecision. Reduction in ulcer size, patient satisfaction/acceptability, pain and cost effectiveness data were also reported but again, we assessed the evidence as being of very low certainty. None of the included trials reported quality of life or pressure ulcer recurrence. Authors' conclusions It is uncertain whether foam dressings are more clinically effective, more acceptable to users, or more cost effective compared to alternative dressings in treating pressure ulcers. It was difficult to make accurate comparisons between foam dressings and other dressings due to the lack of data on reduction of wound size, complete wound healing, treatment costs, or insufficient time‐frames. Quality of life and patient (or carer) acceptability/satisfaction associated with foam dressings were not systematically measured in any of the included studies. We assessed the certainty of the evidence in the included trials as low to very low. Clinicians need to carefully consider the lack of robust evidence in relation to the clinical and cost‐effectiveness of foam dressings for treating pressure ulcers when making treatment decisions, particularly when considering the wound management properties that may be offered by each dressing type and the care context. Plain language summary Foam dressings for treating pressure ulcers What is the aim of this review? The aim of this review was to find out whether foam dressings (designed to absorb fluid from wounds whilst keeping them moist) have any advantages or disadvantages in healing pressure ulcers compared with other dressings (such as silicone foam dressings, hydrocolloid, hydrogel or basic wound dressings). Researchers from Cochrane collected and analysed all relevant studies (randomised controlled trials) to answer this question and found nine relevant studies. Key messages There is no clear evidence from any of the studies included in this review that foam dressings are more effective at healing pressure ulcers than other types of dressings; or that foam dressings are more cost effective than other dressings. This is due in part to the low quality of the studies, many of which had small numbers of participants and did not provide accurate details of their methods. What was studied in the review? Pressure ulcers (pressure injuries or bed sores) are wounds that develop on bony parts of the body such as the heels, hips and lower back. Sitting or lying in the same position for long periods can cause damage to the skin and underlying tissue. People at risk of developing pressure ulcers include those with limited physical mobility such as people with spinal cord injuries, older people, or those ill in hospital. Pressure ulcer treatment is a significant burden to patients, their carer(s) and healthcare systems worldwide. Treatments for pressure ulcers include dressings, antibiotics and antiseptics, and pressure‐relieving mattresses or cushions. There are many wound dressings available to treat pressure ulcers, which vary in cost and may have differing degrees of effectiveness. Foam dressings are designed to absorb fluid (exudate) that comes from some pressure ulcer wounds, and to maintain a moist environment. We wanted to find out how foam dressings affected pressure ulcer healing and recurrence rates. We also wanted to find out whether foam dressings had an impact on participants’ quality of life and satisfaction with treatment, and whether there were any side effects such as infection or pain. We also evaluated the cost of foam dressings compared to other treatments. What are the main results of the review? We found nine studies published between 1994 and 2016 involving a total of 483 participants with pressure ulcers at Category/Stage II or above (open wounds). Seven of the nine trials had more female participants than male. On average people in these studies were 59 years or older. The studies compared foam dressings with other types of dressings, however, there was no clear evidence to indicate foam dressings were more effective at healing pressure ulcers than other types of dressings, or more cost effective. Evidence regarding reduction in ulcer size, patient satisfaction and pain is very uncertain. None of the studies reported on participants’ quality of life or pressure ulcer recurrence. The majority of studies found the dressings evaluated were no better or worse than others on the market. So, while foam dressings can be safely used for the treatment for pressure ulcers, their effect on wound healing is not supported by scientific evidence. Generally, the studies we found did not have many participants and the results were often inconclusive. Overall the evidence that exists is of very low quality. How up to date is this review? We searched for studies that had been published up to February 2017."
Psychological interventions to foster resilience in healthcare students,"Kunzler, AM; Helmreich, I; König, J; Chmitorz, A; Wessa, M; Binder, H; Lieb, K","Abstract - Background Resilience can be defined as maintaining or regaining mental health during or after significant adversities such as a potentially traumatising event, challenging life circumstances, a critical life transition or physical illness. Healthcare students, such as medical, nursing, psychology and social work students, are exposed to various study‐ and work‐related stressors, the latter particularly during later phases of health professional education. They are at increased risk of developing symptoms of burnout or mental disorders. This population may benefit from resilience‐promoting training programmes. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions to foster resilience in healthcare students, that is, students in training for health professions delivering direct medical care (e.g. medical, nursing, midwifery or paramedic students), and those in training for allied health professions, as distinct from medical care (e.g. psychology, physical therapy or social work students). Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, 11 other databases and three trial registries from 1990 to June 2019. We checked reference lists and contacted researchers in the field. We updated this search in four key databases in June 2020, but we have not yet incorporated these results. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any form of psychological intervention to foster resilience, hardiness or post‐traumatic growth versus no intervention, waiting list, usual care, and active or attention control, in adults (18 years and older), who are healthcare students. Primary outcomes were resilience, anxiety, depression, stress or stress perception, and well‐being or quality of life. Secondary outcomes were resilience factors. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, assessed risks of bias, and rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach (at post‐test only). Main results We included 30 RCTs, of which 24 were set in high‐income countries and six in (upper‐ to lower‐) middle‐income countries. Twenty‐two studies focused solely on healthcare students (1315 participants; number randomised not specified for two studies), including both students in health professions delivering direct medical care and those in allied health professions, such as psychology and physical therapy. Half of the studies were conducted in a university or school setting, including nursing/midwifery students or medical students. Eight studies investigated mixed samples (1365 participants), with healthcare students and participants outside of a health professional study field. Participants mainly included women (63.3% to 67.3% in mixed samples) from young adulthood (mean age range, if reported: 19.5 to 26.83 years; 19.35 to 38.14 years in mixed samples). Seventeen of the studies investigated group interventions of high training intensity (11 studies; > 12 hours/sessions), that were delivered face‐to‐face (17 studies). Of the included studies, eight compared a resilience training based on mindfulness versus unspecific comparators (e.g. wait‐list). The studies were funded by different sources (e.g. universities, foundations), or a combination of various sources (four studies). Seven studies did not specify a potential funder, and three studies received no funding support. Risk of bias was high or unclear, with main flaws in performance, detection, attrition and reporting bias domains. At post‐intervention, very‐low certainty evidence indicated that, compared to controls, healthcare students receiving resilience training may report higher levels of resilience (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.78; 9 studies, 561 participants), lower levels of anxiety (SMD −0.45, 95% CI −0.84 to −0.06; 7 studies, 362 participants), and lower levels of stress or stress perception (SMD −0.28, 95% CI −0.48 to −0.09; 7 studies, 420 participants). Effect sizes varied between small and moderate. There was little or no evidence of any effect of resilience training on depression (SMD −0.20, 95% CI −0.52 to 0.11; 6 studies, 332 participants; very‐low certainty evidence) or well‐being or quality of life (SMD 0.15, 95% CI −0.14 to 0.43; 4 studies, 251 participants; very‐low certainty evidence). Adverse effects were measured in four studies, but data were only reported for three of them. None of the three studies reported any adverse events occurring during the study (very‐low certainty of evidence). Authors' conclusions For healthcare students, there is very‐low certainty evidence for the effect of resilience training on resilience, anxiety, and stress or stress perception at post‐intervention. The heterogeneous interventions, the paucity of short‐, medium‐ or long‐term data, and the geographical distribution restricted to high‐income countries limit the generalisability of results. Conclusions should therefore be drawn cautiously. Since the findings suggest positive effects of resilience training for healthcare students with very‐low certainty evidence, high‐quality replications and improved study designs (e.g. a consensus on the definition of resilience, the assessment of individual stressor exposure, more attention controls, and longer follow‐up periods) are clearly needed. Plain language summary Psychological interventions to foster resilience in healthcare students Background  Healthcare students (e.g. medical, nursing, midwifery, paramedic, psychology, physical therapy, or social work students) have a high academic work load, are required to pass examinations and are exposed to human suffering. This can adversely affect their physical and mental health. Interventions to protect them against such stresses are known as resilience interventions. Previous systematic reviews suggest that resilience interventions can help students cope with stress and protect them against adverse consequences on their physical and mental health. Review question  Do psychological interventions designed to foster resilience improve resilience, mental health, and other factors associated with resilience in healthcare students? Search dates  The evidence is current to June 2019. The results of an updated search of four key databases in June 2020 have not yet been included in the review. Study characteristics  We found 30 randomised controlled trials (studies in which participants are assigned to either an intervention or a control group by a procedure similar to tossing a coin). The studies evaluated a range of resilience interventions in participants aged on average between 19 and 38 years. Healthcare students were the focus of 22 studies, with a total of 1315 participants (not specified for two studies). Eight studies included mixed samples (1365 participants) of healthcare students and non‐healthcare students. Eight of the included studies compared a mindfulness‐based resilience intervention (i.e. an intervention fostering attention on the present moment, without judgements) versus unspecific comparators (e.g. wait‐list control receiving the training after a waiting period). Most interventions were performed in groups (17/30), with high training intensity of more than 12 hours or sessions (11/30), and were delivered face‐to‐face (i.e. with direct contact and face‐to‐face meetings between the intervention provider and the participants; 17/30). The included studies were funded by different sources (e.g. universities, foundations), or a combination of various sources (four studies). Seven studies did not specify a potential funder, and three studies received no funding support. Certainty of the evidence  A number of things reduce the certainty about whether resilience interventions are effective. These include limitations in the methods of the studies, different results across studies, the small number of participants in most studies, and the fact that the findings are limited to certain participants, interventions and comparators. Key results  Resilience training for healthcare students may improve resilience, and may reduce symptoms of anxiety and stress immediately after the end of treatment. Resilience interventions do not appear to reduce depressive symptoms or to improve well‐being. However, the evidence from this review is limited and very uncertain. This means that we currently have very little confidence that resilience interventions make a difference to these outcomes and that further research is very likely to change the findings. Very few studies reported on the short‐ and medium‐term impact of resilience interventions. Long‐term follow‐up assessments were not available for any outcome. Studies used a variety of different outcome measures and intervention designs, making it difficult to draw general conclusions from the findings. Potential adverse events were only examined in four studies, with three of them showing no undesired effects and one reporting no results. More research is needed, of high methodological quality and with improved study designs."

Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived therapies for regeneration after central nervous system injury,Stephen Vidman;Yee Hang Ethan Ma;Nolan Fullenkamp;Giles W.Plant;,"In recent years, the progression of stem cell therapies has shown great promise in advancing the nascent field of regenerative medicine. Considering the non-regenerative nature of the mature central nervous system, the concept that “blank” cells could be reprogrammed and functionally integrated into host neural networks remained intriguing. Previous work has also demonstrated the ability of such cells to stimulate intrinsic growth programs in post-mitotic cells, such as neurons. While embryonic stem cells demonstrated great potential in treating central nervous system pathologies, ethical and technical concerns remained. These barriers, along with the clear necessity for this type of treatment, ultimately prompted the advent of induced pluripotent stem cells. The advantage of pluripotent cells in central nervous system regeneration is multifaceted, permitting differentiation into neural stem cells, neural progenitor cells, glia, and various neuronal subpopulations. The precise spatiotemporal application of extrinsic growth factors in vitro, in addition to microenvironmental signaling in vivo, influences the efficiency of this directed differentiation. While the pluri-or multipotency of these cells is appealing, it also poses the risk of unregulated differentiation and teratoma formation. Cells of the neuroectodermal lineage, such as neuronal subpopulations and glia, have been explored with varying degrees of success. Although the risk of cancer or teratoma formation is greatly reduced, each subpopulation varies in effectiveness and is influenced by a myriad of factors, such as the timing of the transplant, pathology type, and the ratio of accompanying progenitor cells. Furthermore, successful transplantation requires innovative approaches to develop delivery vectors that can mitigate cell death and support integration. Lastly, host immune responses to allogeneic grafts must be thoroughly characterized and further developed to reduce the need for immunosuppression. Translation to a clinical setting will involve careful consideration when assessing both physiologic and functional outcomes. This review will highlight both successes and challenges faced when using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cell transplantation therapies to promote endogenous regeneration."
Treatment of spinal cord injury with biomaterials and stem cell therapy in non-human primates and humans,Ana Milena Silva Olaya;Fernanda Martins Almeida;Ana Maria Blanco Martinez;Suelen Adriani Marques;,"Spinal cord injury results in the loss of sensory, motor, and autonomic functions, which almost always produces permanent physical disability. Thus, in the search for more effective treatments than those already applied for years, which are not entirely efficient, researches have been able to demonstrate the potential of biological strategies using biomaterials to tissue manufacturing through bioengineering and stem cell therapy as a neuroregenerative approach, seeking to promote neuronal recovery after spinal cord injury. Each of these strategies has been developed and meticulously evaluated in several animal models with the aim of analyzing the potential of interventions for neuronal repair and, consequently, boosting functional recovery. Although the majority of experimental research has been conducted in rodents, there is increasing recognition of the importance, and need, of evaluating the safety and efficacy of these interventions in non-human primates before moving to clinical trials involving therapies potentially promising in humans. This article is a literature review from databases(PubMed, Science Direct, Elsevier, Scielo, Redalyc, Cochrane, and NCBI) from 10 years ago to date, using keywords(spinal cord injury, cell therapy, non-human primates, humans, and bioengineering in spinal cord injury). From 110 retrieved articles, after two selection rounds based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, 21 articles were analyzed. Thus, this review arises from the need to recognize the experimental therapeutic advances applied in non-human primates and even humans, aimed at deepening these strategies and identifying the advantages and influence of the results on extrapolation for clinical applicability in humans."
The combined application of stem cells and three-dimensional bioprinting scaffolds for the repair of spinal cord injury,Dingyue Ju;Chuanming Dong;,"Spinal cord injury is considered one of the most difficult injuries to repair and has one of the worst prognoses for injuries to the nervous system.Following surgery,the poor regenerative capacity of nerve cells and the generation of new scars can make it very difficult for the impaired nervous system to restore its neural functionality.Traditional treatments can only alleviate secondary injuries but cannot fundamentally repair the spinal cord.Consequently,there is a critical need to develop new treatments to promote functional repair after spinal cord injury.Over recent years,there have been seve ral developments in the use of stem cell therapy for the treatment of spinal cord injury.Alongside significant developments in the field of tissue engineering,three-dimensional bioprinting technology has become a hot research topic due to its ability to accurately print complex structures.This led to the loading of three-dimensional bioprinting scaffolds which provided precise cell localization.These three-dimensional bioprinting scaffolds co uld repair damaged neural circuits and had the potential to repair the damaged spinal cord.In this review,we discuss the mechanisms underlying simple stem cell therapy,the application of different types of stem cells for the treatment of spinal cord injury,and the different manufa cturing methods for three-dimensional bioprinting scaffolds.In particular,we focus on the development of three-dimensional bioprinting scaffolds for the treatment of spinal cord injury."

Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles therapy in traumatic central nervous system diseases:a systematic review and meta-analysis,Zhelun Yang;Zeyan Liang;Jian Rao;Fabin Lin;Yike Lin;Xiongjie Xu;Chunhua Wang;Chunmei Chen;,"Although there are challenges in treating traumatic central nervous system diseases,mesenchymal stem cell-de rived extracellular vesicles(MSC-EVs) have recently proven to be a promising non-cellular the rapy.We comprehensively evaluated the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cell-de rived extracellular vesicles in traumatic central nervous system diseases in this meta-analysis based on preclinical studies.Our meta-analysis was registered at PROSPERO(CRD42022327904,May 24,2022).To fully retrieve the most relevant articles,the following databases were thoro ughly searched:PubMed,Web of Science,The Cochrane Library,and Ovid-Embase(up to April 1,2022).The included studies were preclinical studies of mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles for traumatic central nervous system diseases.The Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation(SYRCLE)'s risk of bias tool was used to examine the risk of publication bias in animal studies.After screening 2347studies,60 studies were included in this study.A meta-analysis was conducted for spinal co rd injury(n=52) and traumatic brain injury(n=8).The results indicated that mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles treatment prominently promoted motor function recovery in spinal co rd injury animals,including rat Basso,Beattie and Bresnahan locomotor rating scale scores(standardized mean difference [SMD]:2.36,95% confidence interval [CI]:1.96-2.76,P <0.01,I~2=71%) and mouse Basso Mouse Scale scores(SMD=2.31,95% CI:1.57-3.04,P=0.01,I~2=60%) compared with controls.Further,mesenchymal stem cell-de rived extracellular vesicles treatment significantly promoted neurological recovery in traumatic brain injury animals,including the modified N eurological Severity Score(SMD=-4.48,95% CI:-6.12 to-2.84,P <0.01,I~2=79%) and Foot Fault Test(SMD=-3.26,95% CI:-4.09 to-2.42,P=0.28,I~2=21%) compared with controls.Subgroup analyses showed that characteristics may be related to the therapeutic effect of mesenchymal stem cell-de rived extra cellular vesicles.For Basso,Beattie and Bresnahan locomotor rating scale scores,the efficacy of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles was higher than that of xenogeneic mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles(allogeneic:SMD=2.54,95% CI:2.05-3.02,P=0.0116,I~2=65.5%;xenogeneic:SMD:1.78,95%CI:1.1-2.45,P=0.0116,I~2=74.6%).Mesenchymal stem cellde rived extracellular vesicles separated by ultrafiltration centrifugation combined with density gradient ultra centrifugation(SMD=3.58,95% CI:2.62-4.53,P <0.0001,I~2=31%) may be more effective than other EV isolation methods.For mouse Basso Mouse Scale scores,placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cell-de rived extracellular vesicles worked better than bone mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles(placenta:SMD=5.25,95% CI:2.45-8.06,P=0.0421,I~2=0%;bone marrow:SMD=1.82,95% CI:1.23-2.41,P=0.0421,I~2=0%).For modified Neurological Severity Score,bone marrow-derived MSC-EVs worked better than adipose-derived MSC-EVs(bone marrow:SMD=-4.86,95% CI:-6.66 to-3.06,P=0.0306,I~2=81%;adipose:SMD=-2.37,95% CI:-3.73 to-1.01,P=0.0306,I~2=0%).Intravenous administration(SMD=-5.47,95% CI:-6.98 to-3.97,P=0.0002,I~2=53.3%) and dose of administration equal to 100 μg(SMD=-5.47,95% CI:-6.98 to-3.97,P <0.0001,I~2=53.3%)showed better res ults than other administration routes and doses.The heterogeneity of studies was small,and sensitivity analysis also indicated stable results.Last,the methodological quality of all trials was mostly satisfactory.In conclusion,in the treatment of traumatic central nervous system diseases,mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles may play a crucial role in promoting motor function recovery."
New insights into the biological roles of immune cells in neural stem cells in post-traumatic injury of the central nervous system,Ning He;Xing-Jia Mao;Yue-Min Ding;Tong Zuo;Ying-Ying Chen;Lin-Lin Wang;,"Traumatic injuries in the central nervous system,such as traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury,are associated with tissue inflammation and the infiltration of immune cells,which simultaneously affect the self-renewal and differentiation of neural stem cells.Howeve r,the tissue repair process instigated by endogenous neural stem cells is incapable of restoring central nervous system injuries without external intervention.Recently,resident/peripheral immune cells have been demonstrated to exert significant effects on neural stem cells.Thus,the resto ration of traumatic injuries in the central nervous system by the immune intervention in neural stem cells represents a potential therapeutic method.In this review,we discuss the roles and possible mechanisms of immune cells on the selfrenewal and differentiation of neural stem cells along with the prognosis of central nervous system injuries based on immune intervention.Finally,we discuss remaining research challenges that need to be considered in the future.Further elucidation of these challenges will fa cilitate the successful application of neural stem cells in central nervous system injuries."
"Mesenchymal stem cells,extracellular vesicles,and transcranial magnetic stimulation for ferroptosis after spinal cord injury",Qi-Feng Song;Qian Cui;Ya-Shi Wang;Li-Xin Zhang;,"Spinal cord injury is characte rized by diffe rent aetiologies,complex pathogenesis,and diverse pathological changes.Current treatments are not ideal,and prognosis is generally poor.After spinal cord injury,neurons die due to various forms of cell death.Among them,fe rroptosis causes dysfunction after spinal cord injury,and no existing traditional treatments have been indicated to block its occurrence.Meanwhile,emerging therapies using mesenchymal stem cells,extracellular vesicles,and transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy are promising for reve rsing spinal co rd neuronal ferroptosis after spinal cord injury.However,no definitive studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of these approaches.This review summarizes the existing research on the mechanisms of ferroptosis;fe rroptosis after spinal cord injury;treatment of spinal cord injury with mesenchymal stem cells,extracellular vesicles,and transc ranial magnetic stimulation;and treatment of ferroptosis using mesenchymal stem cells,extracellular vesicles,and transc ranial magnetic stimulation.Inhibiting ferroptosis can promote the reversal of neurological dysfunction after spinal cord injury.In addition,mesenchymal stem cells,extracellular vesicles,and transc ranial magnetic stimulation can reve rse adverse outcomes of spinal cord injury and regulate ferroptosis-related fa ctors.Thus,it can be inferred that mesenchymal stem cells,extracellular vesicles,and transcranial magnetic stimulation have the potential to inhibit fe rroptosis after spinal cord injury.This review serves as a reference for future research to confirm these conclusions."

Progress in clinical trials of cell transplantation for the treatment of spinal cord injury:how many questions remain unanswered?,Xu-Chang Hu;Yu-Bao Lu;Yong-Na Yang;Xue-Wen Kang;Yong-Gang Wang;Bing Ma;Shuai Xing;,"Spinal cord injury can lead to severe motor,sensory and autonomic nervous dysfunctions.However,there is currently no effective treatment for spinal cord injury.Neural stem cells and progenitor cells,bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells,olfactory ensheathing cells,umbilical cord blood stem cells,adipose stem cells,hematopoietic stem cells,oligodendrocyte precursor cells,macrophages and Schwann cells have been studied as potential treatments for spinal cord injury.These treatments were mainly performed in animals.However,subtle changes in sensory function,nerve root movement and pain cannot be fully investigated with animal studies.Although these cell types have shown excellent safety and effectiveness in various animal models,sufficient evidence of efficacy for clinical translation is still lacking.Cell transplantation should be combined with tissue engineering scaffolds,local drug delivery systems,postoperative adjuvant therapy and physical rehabilitation training as part of a comprehensive treatment plan to provide the possibility for patients with SCI to return to normal life.This review summarizes and analyzes the clinical trials of cell transplantation therapy in spinal cord injury,with the aim of providing a rational foundation for the development of clinical treatments for spinal cord injury."
Combined administration of platelet rich plasma and autologous bone marrow aspirate concentrate for spinal cord injury: a descriptive case series,Joseph A.Shehadi;Steven M.Elzein;Paul Beery;M.Chance Spalding;Michelle Pershing;,"Administration of platelet rich plasma(PRP) and bone marrow aspirate concentrate(BMAC) has shown some promise in the treatment of neurological conditions; however, there is limited information on combined administration. As such, the purpose of this study was to assess safety and functional outcomes for patients administered combined autologous PRP and BMAC for spinal cord injury(SCI). This retrospective case series included seven patients who received combined treatment of autologous PRP and BMAC via intravenous and intrathecal administration as salvage therapy for SCI. Patients were reviewed for adverse reactions and clinical outcomes using the Oswestry Disability Index(ODI) for up to 1 year, as permitted by availability of follow-up data. Injury levels ranged from C3 through T11, and elapsed time between injury and salvage therapy ranged from 2.4 months to 6.2 years. Post-procedure complications were mild and rare, consisting only of self-limited headache and subjective memory impairment in one patient. Four patients experienced severe disability prior to PRP combined with BMAC injection, as evidenced by high(> 48/100) Oswestry Disability Index scores. Longitudinal Oswestry Disability Index scores for two patients with incomplete SCI at C6 and C7, both of whom had cervical spine injuries, demonstrated a decrease of 28–40% following salvage therapy, representing an improvement from severe to minimal disability. In conclusion, intrathecal/intravenous co-administration of PRP and BMAC resulted in no significant complications and may have had some clinical benefits. Larger clinical studies are needed to further test this method of treatment for patients with SCI who otherwise have limited meaningful treatment options. This study was reviewed and approved by the Ohio Health Institutional Review Board(IRB No. 1204946) on May 16, 2018."

Effects of neural stem cell transplantation on the motor function of rats with contusion spinal cord injuries:a meta-analysis,Kai Qian;Tuo-Ye Xu;Xi Wang;Tao Ma;Kai-Xin Zhang;Kun Yang;Teng-Da Qian;Jing Shi;Li-Xin Li;Zheng Wang;,"Objective:To judge the efficacies of neural stem cell(NSC)transplantation on functional recovery following contusion spinal cord injuries(SCIs).Data sources:Studies in which NSCs were transplanted into a clinically relevant,standardized rat model of contusion SCI were identified by searching the PubMed,Embase and Cochrane databases,and the extracted data were analyzed by Stata 14.0.Data selection:Inclusion criteria were that NSCs were used in in vivo animal studies to treat contusion SCIs and that behavioral assessment of locomotor functional recovery was performed using the Basso,Beattie,and Bresnahan lo-comotor rating scale.Exclusion criteria included a follow-up of less than 4 weeks and the lack of control groups.Outcome measures:The restoration of motor function was assessed by the Basso,Beattie,and Bresnahan locomotor rating scale.Results:We identified 1756 non-duplicated papers by searching the aforementioned electronic databases,and 30 full-text articles met the inclusion criteria.A total of 37 studies reported in the 30 articles were included in the meta-analysis.The meta-analysis results showed that transplanted NSCs could improve the motor function recovery of rats following contusion SCIs,to a moderate extent(pooled standardized mean difference(SMD)=0.73;95%confidence interval(CI):0.47-1.00;P<0.001).NSCs obtained from different donor species(rat:SMD=0.74;95%CI:0.36-1.13;human:SMD=0.78;95%CI:0.31-1.25),at different donor ages(fetal:SMD=0.67;95%CI:0.43-0.92;adult:SMD=0.86;95%CI:0.50-1.22)and from different origins(brain-derived:SMD=0.59;95%CI:0.27-0.91;spinal cord-derived:SMD=0.51;95%CI:0.22-0.79)had similar efficacies on improved functional recovery;however,adult induced pluripotent stem cell-derived NSCs showed no significant efficacies.Furthermore,the use of higher doses of transplanted NSCs or the administration of immunosuppressive agents did not promote better locomotor function recovery(SMD=0.45;95%CI:0.21-0.70).However,shorter periods between the contusion induction and the NSC transplantation showed slightly higher efficacies(acute:SMD=1.22;95%CI:0.81-1.63;subacute:SMD=0.75;95%CI:0.42-1.09).For chronic injuries,NSC implantation did not significantly improve functional recovery(SMD=0.25;95%CI:-0.16 to 0.65).Conclusion:NSC transplantation alone appears to be a positive yet limited method for the treatment of contusion SCIs."
Stem cell transplantation for spinal cord injury: a meta-analysis of treatment effectiveness and safety,Xiao Fan;Jin-zhao Wang;Xiao-min Lin;Li Zhang;,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of stem cell transplantation for spinal cord injury(SCI).DATA SOURCES: PubM ed, EMBASE, Cochrane, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Science and Technology Journal, Wanfang, and Sino Med databases were systematically searched by computer to select clinical randomized controlled trials using stem cell transplantation to treat SCI, published between each database initiation and July 2016. DATA SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials comparing stem cell transplantation with rehabilitation treatment for patients with SCI. Inclusion criteria:(1) Patients with SCI diagnosed according to the American Spinal Injury Association(ASIA) International standards for neurological classification of SCI;(2) patients with SCI who received only stem cell transplantation therapy or stem cell transplantation combined with rehabilitation therapy;(3) one or more of the following outcomes reported: outcomes concerning neurological function including sensory function and locomotor function, activities of daily living, urination functions, and severity of SCI or adverse effects. Studies comprising patients with complications, without full-text, and preclinical animal models were excluded. Quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool and Rev Man V5.3 software, provided by the Cochrane Collaboration, was used to perform statistical analysis. OUTCOME MEASURES: ASIA motor score, ASIA light touch score, ASIA pinprick score, ASIA impairment scale grading improvement rate, activities of daily living score, residual urine volume, and adverse events.RESULTS: Ten studies comprising 377 patients were included in the analysis and the overall risk of bias was relatively low level. Four studies did not detail how random sequences were generated, two studies did not clearly state the blinding outcome assessment, two studies lacked blinding outcome assessment, one study lacked follow-up information, and four studies carried out selective reporting. Compared with rehabilitation therapy, stem cell transplantation significantly increased the lower limb light touch score(odds ratio(OR) = 3.43, 95% confidence interval(CI): 0.01 – 6.86, P = 0.05), lower limb pinprick score(OR = 3.93, 95%CI: 0.74 – 7.12, P = 0.02), ASI grading rate(relative risk(RR) = 2.95, 95%CI: 1.64 – 5.29, P = 0.0003), and notably reduced residual urine volume(OR = –8.10, 95%CI: –15.09 to –1.10, P = 0.02). However, stem cell transplantation did not significantly improve motor score(OR = 1.89, 95%CI: –0.25 to 4.03, P = 0.08) or activities of daily living score(OR = 1.12, 95%CI: –1.17 to 4.04, P = 0.45). Furthermore, stem cell transplantation caused a high rate of mild adverse effects(RR = 14.49, 95%CI: 5.34 – 34.08, P < 0.00001); however, these were alleviated in a short time. CONCLUSION: Stem cell transplantation was determined to be an efficient and safe treatment for SCI and simultaneously improved sensory and bladder functions. Although associated minor and temporary adverse effects were observed with transplanted stem cells, spinal cord repair and axon remyelination were apparent. More randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up times are needed to further validate the effectiveness of stem cell transplantation in the treatment of SCI."

骨髓间充质干细胞移植对脊髓损伤不同时期胶质细胞影响的研究进展,张立新;,"脊髓损伤(spinal cord injury,SCI)是一种严重威胁人类健康及生存质量的疾病,并且主要发病人群为青壮年,目前尚无确切的治疗方法。利用骨髓基质干细胞移植(mesenchymal stem cells,MSCs)治疗SCI已日渐成熟,动物实验证明通过MSCs的移植治疗SCI后病灶囊腔缩小,感觉及运动功能均有较大的改善,但其具体的作用机制还处于探索阶段。胶质细胞也称神经胶质,是除了神经元以外广泛分布于中枢神经系统内的重要组成部分,参与神经系统的修复和再生等作用,神经轴突再生过程必须有胶质细胞的引导才能成功。在正常脊髓组织中,星型胶质细胞、少突胶质细胞和小胶质细胞三者均扮有各自重要的角色,在SCI后,胶质细胞会发生一系列的变化应对损伤,在不同时期会有不同的转变,具有不同作用。本文对MSCs移植治疗SCI后不同胶质细胞变化情况进行综述,希望提供针对性治疗SCI的有意义线索。"
激活mTOR通路对脊髓损伤大鼠运动功能影响的Meta分析,刘海库,"脊髓损伤(SCI)的治疗目前面临着一些挑战,主要是由于哺乳动物受损中枢神经轴突的内在再生能力不足、外源性微环境的抑制以及神经营养因子的缺乏。因此科研工作者们将目光聚焦激活神经元内在再生能力和改善外部环境的研究。激活哺乳动物雷帕霉素靶蛋白(mTOR)通路是重要的神经内在再生信号通路之一。mTOR在控制脊髓神经元凋亡、轴突再生中起重要作用。同时,mTOR还可以调节炎症反应,影响胶质瘢痕形成,从而改善神经元的外部环境。因此,激活mTOR信号通路很可能成为SCI新的治疗干预措施的有效靶点。但是在实验研究中,因为选用的损伤模型、脊髓损伤程度、干预措施、干预途径和干预时间的不同,导致激活mTOR通路治疗脊髓损伤的效果差别很大。因此,本研究针对激活mTOR通路促进SCI大鼠运动功能改善及可能的机制采用Meta分析方法对已发表的大鼠脊髓损伤相关试验研究进行二次分析,以期为激活mTOR通路改善脊髓损伤后的运动功能提供理论依据。 方法: 通过Pubmed、Embase、Web of science进行系统的文献检索,检索时间从建库至2023年10月10日。收集关于激活mTOR通路促进SCI大鼠运动功能改善的文献。采用Stata15.0软件进行Meta分析。文献的异质性分析采用I2检验。结合Meta回归及亚组分析寻找异质性的来源。发表偏倚检验采用漏斗图法、Egger回归法、Begg秩相关法。对存在发表偏倚的危险因素采用剪补法调整合并效应量。 结果: (1)研究共纳入参考文献28篇,共564只大鼠。提取28篇文献BBB评分数据。mTOR激活组BBB评分效应量都明显高于对照组,且随时间逐渐增加[7天(WMD=2.29,95%CI=1.70～2.89,P=0.000)、14天(WMD=3.07,95%CI=2.52～3.61,P=0.000)、21天(WMD=3.59,95%CI=2.76～4.41,P=0.000)、28天(WMD=3.99,95%CI=2.91～5.07,P=0.000)]。 (2)漏斗图存在不对称且Egger检验P<0.05,提示存在一定的发表偏倚。回归分析未找到发表偏倚的原因。采用了剪补法和敏感性分析表明结果稳健。 (3)BBB评分的亚组分析表明7天时基因治疗效应量(WMD=3.241,95%CI=0.724～5.758,P=0.000)高于其他干预措施;28天时间充质干细胞外泌体治疗(WMD=5.13,95%CI=3.20～7.06,P=0.000)、组织工程治疗(WMD=4.65,95%CI=3.64～5.66,P=0.000)和物理治疗(WMD=4.30,95%CI=-1.35～9.94,P=0.14)效应量高于单纯药物治疗(WMD=2.86,95%CI=2.28～3.45,P=0.000)。损伤局部治疗和鞘内给药效应量高于皮下注射和腹腔注射。每天干预的效应量高于只干预一次。损伤后当天干预效应量高于损伤前干预和损伤后7天干预效应量的2倍。 (4)8篇文献检测神经丝蛋白(NF)的表达,mTOR激活组明显高于对照组(SMD=6.79,95%CI=4.37～9.21,P=0.000)。2篇文献研究结果表明mTOR激活组髓鞘碱性蛋白(MBP)的表达水平均高于脊髓损伤组(SMD=0.39,95%CI=0.2～0.58,P=0.011)。 (5)4篇文献统计了Nissl染色的神经元数量,mTOR激活组神经元数量高于对照组(SMD=4.38,95%CI=1.97～6.78,P=0.000)。6篇文献用TUNEL方法检测细胞凋亡,mTOR激活组凋亡效应量明显低于对照组(SMD=-6.370,95%CI=-7.943～-4.797,P=0.000)。两篇文章检测自噬标志物LC3BII/LC3BI比值,激活mTOR组的自噬效应量低于SCI组(WMD=-0.63,95%CI=-0.68～-0.57,P=0.000)。 (6)7篇文献统计了胶质瘢痕主要蛋白GFAP的表达,mTOR激活组效应量明显低于对照组(SMD=-3.54,95%CI=-6.14～-0.94,P=0.008)。 (7)2篇文献mTOR激活组IL-1β和IL-6的表达水平均低于脊髓损伤组(IL-1β:SMD=-1.57,95%CI=-3.36～0.23,P=0.087;IL-6:SMD=-2.03,95%CI=-2.86～-1.21,P=0.000)。 结论: (1)脊髓损伤后及时、多次、鞘内局部激活mTOR通路可以减少细胞凋亡,促进神经纤维修复及髓鞘形成,从而改善脊髓损伤大鼠的运动功能。 (2)早期局部给予基因干预结合间充质干细胞外泌体或组织工程治疗,慢性期再配合物理疗法可能是很有前景的治疗脊髓损伤的策略。"
基于基因组学和机器学习探讨脊髓损伤后线粒体代谢相关标志物表达情况的研究,焦坤,"【研究背景】 脊髓损伤(Spinal Cord Injury,SCI)是一种严重的以运动和感觉功能受损为主要临床表现的致残性疾病。据统计,我国SCI患者超过300万例,全球每年新增SCI患者超过25万例,目前约有超过2700万患者因SCI导致运动功能障碍,进而引起肌肉萎缩、骨质疏松、疼痛、心理及认知障碍等严重后遗症,在美国平均每位SCI患者每年花费7万美元,给患者家庭和社会带来极为沉重的负担。目前治疗脊髓损伤的方法主要包括减压治疗、药物治疗、局部冷疗以及干细胞治疗等。其中,手术治疗必须在关键时间窗内,且对患者创伤较大;大剂量激素冲击等药物治疗只能短期使用;细胞移植疗法存在伦理问题,且具有一定致畸性。因此,阐明SCI的病理生理机制、提供新的干预靶点是临床医学的迫切需求,也是基础研究的热门方向。 【研究目的】 1、基于基因组学和机器学习算法获得与线粒体代谢相关的关键差异基因 2、构建体内动物脊髓损伤模型,观察关键基因及其蛋白的表达情况 3、探究在细胞模型中对细胞增殖及减轻炎症反应具有正向调控作用的关键基因 【研究方法】 1、通过GEO(Gene Expression Omnibus)公共数据库获取SD大鼠脊髓损伤节段样本微阵列数据。使用R软件对样本数据进行分析,筛选差异基因。与线粒体代谢相关基因交集,得到重叠的线粒体代谢相关差异基因。通过多数据库联合机器学习算法计算基因重要性评分,预测关键基因。 2、通过构建SD大鼠脊髓损伤撞击模型,评估造模成功性。于造模后3天取样,使用q RT-PCR和Western Blot技术检测关键基因及蛋白表达量在造模前后的变化情况,验证生物信息学分析结果是否正确。 3、基于上述研究筛选得到目的基因,通过体外实验探索干预其表达后对细胞活性及炎症因子的影响。研究通过前期的数据挖掘和实验验证,选取了Bid作为研究的目的基因。利用LPS诱导BV2小胶质细胞构建炎症损伤模型,CCK-8(Cell Counting Kit-8)法检测对细胞增殖的影响,ELISA法检测炎症因子表达的变化,选取最适LPS浓度。通过si RNA技术沉默Bid基因,WB检测其蛋白在干预前后的表达变化情况,CCK-8法验证对细胞增殖的促进作用,ELISA实验验证对炎症因子表达的抑制作用。 【研究结果】 1、我们基于GEO数据库获取了脊髓损伤大鼠损伤节段脊髓样本和正常对照的脊髓样本微阵列数据信息并进行整合分析。将筛选出来的差异基因同线粒体代谢相关基因集结合,鉴定出97个既与脊髓损伤相关又与线粒体代谢相关的差异基因(Mito DEGs),其中上调基因21个,下调基因76个。通过两个蛋白质数据库分析,使用Cytoscape中的MCODE算法和Cyto Hubba算法鉴别重要模块和候选的25个关键基因。根据CTD数据库和多种机器学习算法对所得的关键基因进行相关性、特征性评分预测,最终得到Bid、Txnrd1、Adhfel为排名前三的关键基因。第一部分的研究针对SCI和线粒体代谢筛选获得潜在的关键基因,其不仅是与SCI密切相关的差异基因,也是能反应SCI过程中线粒体代谢状态的关键基因,同时也具有潜在治疗SCI的能力,为临床医生提供全新的SCI治疗策略和思路。 2、第二部分我们通过Allen法构建标准化SD大鼠脊髓损伤撞击模型,由两位专业人员分别在造模前、12h、24h、48h、72h五个时间点对损伤组和假手术对照组大鼠进行BBB评分(Basso,Beattie&Bresnahan locomotor rating scale,BBB scale),结果显示损伤组大鼠术后基本为全瘫痪状态,而假手术对照组大鼠基本为正常状态,提示大鼠SCI造模是成功的。在造模后第3天处死大鼠获取造模节段脊髓组织样本,通过q RT-PCR实验分析23个关键基因在损伤组和对照组的表达量变化,结果显示,Acss1、Adhfe1、Coq9、Ech1、Idh2、Sirt3、Txnrd1、Coq10a、Oxct1、Aldh1l2、Acsl6在损伤后明显下调,Acacb、Aldh1l1、Bid、Coq7在损伤后明显上调,而Acsl1、Casp3、Hmgcs2、Mlycd、Endog、Coq3、Bdh1、Sirt5在损伤前后无统计学意义。根据PCR结果,结合机器学习预测结果,通过查阅文献选择了Bid基因作为后续研究的目的基因,同时通过Western-blot技术验证了BID蛋白在损伤前后表达量的变化,其结果与PCR相吻合。 3、基于上述研究挖掘得到的Bid基因,我们通过细胞实验探索干预Bid基因及蛋白的表达来治疗SCI的潜能。研究利用LPS体外诱导BV2小胶质细胞建立炎症损伤模型,通过CCK-8实验验证了LPS对BV2细胞增殖的抑制作用,ELISA法验证了炎症因子在造模后表达升高,选取合适的LPS浓度为100μg/ml,成功构建了LPS诱导的BV2小胶质细胞炎症损伤模型。通过si RNA技术沉默Bid基因的表达,WB结果证明其蛋白在沉默后表达量较前升高,CCK-8结果显示沉默Bid表达对BV2细胞增殖具有促进作用,ELISA法检测炎症因子表达也明显少于对照组,提示可以一定程度抑制炎症反应。 【研究结论】 本研究基于基因组学数据分析,结合多数据库和机器学习算法,通过对差异基因的筛选和预测得到潜在的与线粒体代谢相关关键基因。使用SD大鼠脊髓损伤撞击模型造模后的脊髓样本进行PCR和WB实验验证上述关键基因的表达变化情况是否与前期分析结果相一致。最终选取Bid基因作为目的基因进行细胞实验验证,通过si RNA技术沉默其表达,观察到具有促进细胞增殖、抑制炎症反应的影响。我们研究认为Bid可能是潜在的治疗SCI的调控靶点,并在更深入的实验中有望成为解决SCI疾病的切入点。"
搭乘中性粒细胞便车的核酸/多肽纳米复合物的构建及其用于脊髓损伤治疗研究,何云洁,"脊髓损伤(spinal cord injury,SCI)是一种由外界物理性创伤导致的中枢神经系统性疾病。SCI后,脊髓微环境失衡,浸润的巨噬细胞持续向促炎表型(M1型)极化,分泌促炎因子,导致周围正常细胞凋亡。与此同时,神经干细胞(neural stem cells,NSCs)向星形胶质细胞分化,形成星形胶质瘢痕以抑制炎症的扩散,然而,瘢痕的长期存在严重抑制了神经与轴突再生。脊髓微环境失衡是导致SCI恢复不良的重要原因,调节损伤脊髓微环境,逆转M1型巨噬细胞的表型,增强NSCs的神经元分化对SCI的治疗至关重要。干扰素调节因子5(interferonregulatoryfactor5,IRF5)是干扰素调节因子家族成员,是巨噬细胞极化的主要调节因子之一。为响应炎症刺激,IRF5诱导炎症基因表达,进而导致巨噬细胞向M1型极化。IRF5 siRNA(siIRF5)能够下调IRF5的表达,促进M1型巨噬细胞向抑炎表型(M2型)转化,促使炎症消退。基质细胞衍生因子-1α 来源的多肽(stromal cell derived factor 1α-derived peptide,SDF-1αpeptide)具有良好的间充质干细胞(mesenchymal stem cells,MSCs)趋化功能,能够募集MSCs至SCI部位,进而促进NSCs的神经元分化。因此,共递送siIRF5/SDF-1α peptide用于改善受损脊髓微环境或许是一种有前景的治疗方案。然而,siIRF5/SDF-1α peptide的共递送具有挑战性,因为体内多重生理屏障严重限制了siIRF5/SDF-1αpeptide的靶向递送,并且siIRF5和SDF-1α peptide分别需要在胞内和胞外发挥作用。因此,本文基于体内生理屏障以及病灶部位微环境特征,发展了一种安全高效、具有损伤脊髓靶向能力的核酸/多肽共递送体系,实现了siIRF5/SDF-1αpeptide的胞内/胞外共递送以及SCI的高效治疗。本文内容如下:在第一章中,首先对SCI进行了概述,阐述了 RNA干扰技术,综述了非病毒基因递送载体的递送屏障及种类、基于细胞便车的纳米递送体系,最后介绍了 SCI的干细胞疗法。在第二章中,设计并合成了中性粒细胞特异性内化、血栓响应性分离的纳米复合物,用于中性粒细胞搭便车、核酸/多肽药物的高效包载以及SCI部位靶向递送。首先通过γ-(4-炔丙氧基苄基)-L-谷氨酸-N-羧酸酐单体开环聚合以及点击化学合成了侧链含葡萄糖的线性α-螺旋阳离子聚多肽(glucose-LPP,GP),GP通过静电相互作用缩合siRNA形成GP/siRNA二元纳米复合物。随后将苯硼酸/SDF-1αpeptide通过酰胺化反应修饰至变性牛血清白蛋白表面制备苯硼酸-SDF-1α peptide-变性牛血清白蛋白(PBA-SDF-1α peptide-dBSA,PSdB)。PSdB 与 GP/siRNA 二元纳米复合物通过可逆硼酸酯键和静电相互作用,形成粒径约为160 nm、电位约为-30 mV的PSdB/GP/siRNA三元纳米复合物。PSdB/GP/siRNA纳米复合物具有良好的体外稳定性和血清稳定性,在搭乘中性粒细胞便车后能够保持结构完整性,并实现SCI部位微血栓响应性分离。在第三章中,利用第二章中构建的三元纳米复合物包载siIRF5和SDF-1αpeptide(PSdB/GP/siIRF5),用于调控脊髓微环境,治疗SCI。体外实验表明,GP/siIRF5纳米复合物诱导了高效的IRF5基因沉默(约72%),促进RAW264.7细胞由M1型向M2型转化,同时PSdB成功诱导MSCs迁移(约3.2倍),促进NSCs向神经元分化。系统给药后,PSdB/GP/siIRF5纳米复合物成功靶向至SCI部位,IRF5的基因沉默效率高达71%,向SCI部位迁移的MSCs数量增加了 7.4倍,Basso Mouse Scale 得分(5.9分)远高于PSdB/GP/siScr(3.2分)和PdB/GP/siIRF5纳米复合物治疗组(3.7分)。siIRF5介导的巨噬细胞极化联合SDF-1αpeptide介导的神经元分化协同改善脊髓损伤微环境,促进SCI修复。总之,本文设计并构建了一种能够搭乘中性粒细胞便车的核酸/多肽纳米复合物,探索了其在SCI治疗中的应用,并在SCI小鼠中展现出良好的疗效,为核酸与多肽药物的体内跨屏障和靶向递送提供了新思路,为SCI治疗提供了新方案。"
自体来源的骨髓间充质干细胞移植在脊髓损伤患者中的应用,夏远亮,"目的:骨髓来源的间充质干细胞(BMSCs)在动物模型中促进脊髓损伤(SCI)修复的作用已经得到了证实。然而,BMSCs移植还没有在临床上广泛应用。BMSCs治疗SCI患者的安全性和有效性仍存在争议。因此,我们汇总了已经发表的自体来源的BMSCs在SCI患者中的使用,以评估其相应的安全性。方法:在Pubmed、Web of Science、Cochrane图书馆、CNKI和万方数据库中进行系统检索2010-2022年已经发表文章中自体来源BMSCs在SCI患者中的应用情况。结果:网状meta分析显示,美国脊髓损伤协会(ASIA)运动和ASIA感觉评分、ASIA损伤量表等级改善、膀胱功能改善、感觉诱发电位(SSEP)改善以及不良反应发生率。Meta分析结果显示,与对照组相比,自体BMSC移植改善了ASIA感觉评分(平均差(MD),8.41;95%置信区间(CI),5.67-11.14),ASIA运动评分(MD,10.34;95%CI,8.33-12.35),ASIA损伤量表等级(相对风险(RR),4.50;95%CI,2.04-9.91),膀胱功能改善(RR,1.93;95%CI,1.06-3.50)和躯体感觉诱发电位(SSEP)改善(RR,2.96;95%CI,1.43-6.12)并且不会引起严重的不良反应发生(RR,1.27;95%CI,0.58-2.77)。结论:自体BMSCs移植可改善SCI患者ASIA感觉评分、ASIA运动功能评分、ASIA损伤量表分级、膀胱功能恢复和SSEP恢复,无严重不良反应。因此,自体BMSCs移植对SCI患者的康复是安全有效的。"

基于小分子药物的体细胞转分化研究,王凯丽,"自核移植以来,细胞重编程经历了一段漫长的研究过程,从细胞融合技术逐渐发展了到转录因子和小分子化合物组合作用诱导细胞重编。目前,小分子诱导的直接重编程——转分化,得到了广泛的关注和深入的研究,在揭示药物作用机制方面取得了相当大的进展。利用小分子直接重编程诱导心肌细胞、肝细胞、神经干细胞和神经元的研究也有很大进展。小分子化合物结构简单,作用靶点清晰,容易合成,分子量小,可以直接替代重编程因子,更容易渗透到细胞中,具有非免疫原性,作用浓度和时间都容易控制,无致瘤性,相对安全,作用可控。就目前研究来看,诱导体系中小分子数量较多,联合作用机制的探究比较困难,且有些小分子水溶性极差,为后续研究展开带来一定的困难。针对此问题,本文筛选出了较少的四个小分子化合物组合(K、F、A、T)和最佳的作用浓度,将其中的难溶性小分子化合物K制备成胶束,将人源成纤维细胞在体外直接进行转分化,诱导成为功能性神经元,提高了诱导效率,避免了转录因子重编程带来的成瘤风险和胚胎干细胞移植所面临的伦理问题。将化学诱导性神经样细胞以纤维蛋白生物支架为载体,原位移植到大鼠脊髓损伤横断部位,介导大鼠脊髓损伤的修复和治疗,为再生医学的细胞移植治疗提供功能细胞的来源。全文从以下六个章节进行阐述。第一章综述本章首先对小分子化合物进行概述,介绍了小分子化合物的概念、作用结果以及作用途径,详细介绍了细胞重编程的发展过程,从最早研究的核移植、细胞融合、细胞提取物诱导重编程,逐渐发展到转录因子介导的细胞重编程,最终发展到现在处于火热研究阶段的全化学诱导细胞重编程,为小分子化合物诱导体细胞转分化为不同类型的成熟功能性细胞的研究提供了参考,同时在这一部分也简单解释重编程与转分化的关系,对全化学诱导体细胞转分化为不同功能性细胞进行详细介绍,包括向心肌细胞、肝细胞、神经细胞等,最后对参与细胞重编程与转分化的小分子及作用性质、脊髓损伤进行介绍,为接下来的研究奠定了坚实的理论基础。第二章小分子化合物胶束的制备及表征由于在体外成神经细胞诱导体系中,小分子K溶解度很低,且在成纤维细胞转分化为神经细胞的诱导过程中发挥关键作用,故本章根据甘草酸具有两亲性结构的增溶作用,采用薄膜分散法,制备小分子化合物K胶束,并建立了体外测定小分子化合物K浓度的高效液相色谱(HPLC)方法。通过对薄膜分散法制备得到的小分子化合物K胶束粒径(PS)、电位(ZP)、多分散系数(PDI)、包封率(EE)与载药量(DL)的考察,确定了投料比(FR)为1:10,水化时间2小时,能够获得最佳粒径57.88±3.01nm、最小Zeta电位-23.53±1.37 m V,多分散系数为0.104±0.006,最高包封率90.24±1.19%和载药量9.22±0.14%,制备出最合适的胶束。第三章小分子诱导体细胞转分化为神经元本章首先对本文用到的体细胞来源进行介绍,详细介绍了体细胞的分离培养过程,为本文的研究提供了充足而优质的细胞来源。通过正交试验筛选出最佳的K、F、A、T四个小分子组合,诱导4天时间就可以直接将人包皮成纤维细胞直接转分化为功能性神经元,出现典型的神经元特征:胞体变小,折光性变强,突起增多,随诱导时间逐渐增加,细胞透亮度增强,轴突变长,通过流式细胞仪检测出诱导效率可达81.5%,通过免疫荧光(IF)、q RT-PCR、Simple Western相互佐证了诱导性神经细胞表达神经元相关基因和蛋白,证明诱导获得的细胞是功能性神经细胞。第四章小分子诱导神经元介导脊髓损伤(SCI)修复研究本章采用横断法构建大鼠脊髓损伤模型,将诱导成熟的神经细胞进行绿色荧光(CFSE)标记,结合纤维蛋白生物支架,直接原位移植到大鼠脊髓损伤部位,介导损伤修复,通过BBB评分、旷场试验、脚印试验等评价其后肢运动功能恢复情况。用生物素化葡聚糖胺(BDA)顺行示踪神经,观察示踪剂能否从大脑沿脊髓向下传递,考察治疗后大鼠脊髓的顺行传导功能是否得到修复;用荧光金(Fluoro-Gold,FG)逆行示踪神经,观察示踪剂能否沿脊髓逆向传递到大脑,考察治疗后大鼠脊髓的逆行传导功能是否得到修复。用Ed U试剂盒检测脊髓损伤部位的细胞增殖情况,活体成像技术检测移植的神经细胞在脊髓中的迁移情况,最后将脊髓组织切片进行免疫荧光染色(IF),鉴定神经相关蛋白Tuj1、MAP2、Tau、Syn GAP、Synpsin 1、NH-H、GAP43等和胶质细胞蛋白GFAP的表达情况,结果证实小分子诱导性神经元移植到损伤部位,大鼠后肢运动功能得到较好恢复,可以在短距离的运动过程中实现前后肢的协调步态行走,而其他各组后肢无法实现负重位站立,仍是拖拽运动,说明小分子化合物K胶束、A、F、T诱导的神经细胞,联合纤维蛋白支架能够促进损伤部位神经元上下连通,形成神经回路,对脊髓损伤有较好的治疗效果。"
miR-338-5p修饰BMSCs来源外泌体对大鼠脊髓损伤后神经功能恢复作用及机制研究,张安维,"背景及目的:脊髓损伤(spinal cord injury,SCI)是一种严重的中枢神经系统损伤性疾病,不仅造成严重的感觉及运动功能障碍,且预后较差。目前,关于治疗脊髓损伤的研究主要包含两大领域:神经保护和再生。然而,脊髓损伤后复杂的病理改变,特别是继发性损伤引起的后续损伤,阻碍了能有效可靠治愈脊髓损伤方法的发展。间充质干细胞在脊髓损伤中的作用已被广泛研究,但许多研究已表明直接移植间充质干细胞有潜在的风险,虽然移植后的间充质干细胞具有神经元样特征,但很难将其视为真正的神经元。根据目前的证据,间充质干细胞的疗效似乎与其旁分泌行为有关,与其细胞替代机制关系不大。外泌体是细胞通讯的重要介质,参与脊髓损伤后诸多病理过程的发展。鉴于其无细胞治疗,穿透血脑屏障或血脊髓屏障等优点,在脊髓损伤中的治疗潜力受到越来越多的关注。特别是外泌体可以作为理想的药物分子载体,携带细胞信号分子如micro RNA(miRNA)对脊髓损伤后的病理调控起到诸多作用。因此,本研究通过构建大鼠脊髓损伤模型,探讨骨髓间充质干细胞(bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells,BMSCs)来源的过表达miR-338-5p外泌体对大鼠脊髓损伤后神经功能的恢复作用及潜在分子机制。方法:第一部分:无菌获取正常SD大鼠(150-200g)双侧股骨组织,采用全骨髓贴壁法分离骨髓间充质干细胞,并通过流式细胞术对第三代细胞表面抗原(CD44,CD90,CD29,CD45,CD24)进行鉴定。随后预先转染miR-338-5p mimics及其negative control至BMSCs构建过表达miR-338-5p的质粒及其对照质粒,收集细胞上清液通过超速离心法提取外泌体,最后通过透射电镜(transmission electron microscopy,TEM)、粒径分析(nanoparticle tracking analysis,NTA)及蛋白印迹法(western blot,WB)鉴定外泌体。通过q RT-PCR分析外泌体中miR-338-5p表达情况。第二部分:首先选取正常雄性SD大鼠(200-280g)随机分为4组:假手术组,SCI后1天组,SCI后4天组,SCI后7天组。通过自制改良Allen’s打击装置构建大鼠T10节段脊髓损伤模型,模型建立完毕后于相应时间点处死大鼠获取T9-T11节段脊髓组织,通过q RT-PCR分析脊髓组织中miR-338-5p表达情况。随后再次选取正常雄性SD大鼠(200-280g)随机分为5组:假手术组,脊髓损伤control组,SCI后PBS干预组,SCI后control exosomes干预组,SCI后miR-338-5p exosomes干预组。根据前述方法建立脊髓损伤模型后,采用原位损伤部位注射结合尾静脉注射方式注入等量PBS或外泌体溶液(100μg)。实验组一部分样本于SCI后4天处死,获取脊髓组织,通过western blot及免疫荧光检测神经丝蛋白(neurofilament protein-M,NF-M),生长相关蛋白(growth associated protein-43,GAP43),髓鞘相关糖蛋白(myelin-associated glycoprotein,MAG),胶质纤维酸性蛋白(glial fibrillary acidic protein,GFAP)表达情况;通过HE染色、Nissl染色观察脊髓组织病理改变情况。实验组其余部分样本于不同时间点(1,3,7,14,21天)进行大鼠脊髓损伤功能行为学评分(Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan,BBB)。第三部分:通过H2O2诱导PC12细胞建立脊髓损伤后氧化应激细胞模型,运用q RT-PCR检测在H2O2诱导下PC12细胞中miR-338-5p的表达情况,以确定H2O2的作用浓度及作用时间;随后运用CCK-8法和流式细胞凋亡分析检测miR-338-5p及其过表达外泌体对PC12细胞活性以及细胞凋亡的影响,并检测细胞活性氧(reactive oxygen species,ROS),超氧化物歧化酶(superoxide dismutase,SOD)的变化情况;最后通过western blot检测NF-M,GAP43,MAG,GFAP以及凋亡相关蛋白在H2O2诱导下PC12细胞中的表达水平。通过Target Scan,miRDB,miRWalk,miRMap,micro T-CDS五个数据库预测rno-miR-338-5p的靶基因m RNAs,通过交集后确定6个可选靶基因。随后通过查阅文献以及KEGG pathway分析,确定大麻素受体1(cannabinoid Receptor 1,Cnr1)作为后续实验的研究对象。运用双荧光素酶报告基因及western blot检测确定miR-338-5p与靶基因Cnr1之间的负调控关系。通过KEGG pathway确定Cnr1下游基因Rap1,随后查阅其可能的调控通路(如MAPK和PI3K/Akt等),运用western blot检测相关蛋白在miR-338-5p过表达情况下是否具有影响细胞增殖、存活的作用。结果:第一部分:通过流式细胞术确定骨髓间充质干细胞表面抗原CD44,CD90,CD29呈阳性,而CD45,CD34呈阴性,说明分离培养出的BMSCs具有间充质特异表型,而不表达造血系表型。随后通过超速离心法分离BMSCs细胞上清液提取外泌体,q RT-PCR结果显示转染miR-338-5p mimics至BMSCs后分泌的外泌体高表达miR-338-5p。同时,通过TEM和NTA分析确定外泌体在透射电镜下呈双层膜状囊泡结构,直径在50-200nm,平均直径100nm。Western blot结果显示外泌体蛋白标志物CD63,CD9,TSG101,HSP70呈阳性表达。第二部分:通过q RT-PCR检测结果分析发现miR-338-5p在大鼠脊髓损伤后呈现表达降低趋势,与假手术组比较,脊髓损伤4天后miR-338-5p表达水平显著降低(p<0.001)。随后western blot及免疫荧光结果显示:miR-338-5p exosomes能显著上调NF-M和GAP43的表达,而显著下调MAG和GFAP的表达;同时,我们还发现control exosomes亦具有类似的作用,此作用仅低于过表达miR-338-5p的exosomes。HE染色与Nissl染色结果表明miR-338-5p exosomes能降低脊髓损伤后组织出血,抑制神经元细胞变性以及促进小胶质细胞增生等病理改变,并且减少尼氏体消失的作用。BBB评分结果:SCI组中SCI后1d,3d双后肢功能无明显变化(p>0.05);SCI后7d,14d,21d时miR-338-5p exosomes组和control exosomes组均较脊髓损伤control组双后肢功能明显改善(p<0.001),其中miR-338-5p exosomes组分别平均达5.8分,11分,14.2分,control exosomes组分别平均达5分,8.2分,10.6分,而脊髓损伤control组和PBS组21d时分别为7.6分,7.4分。第三部分:通过H2O2诱导PC12细胞建立氧化应激模型发现当加入浓度300μM H2O2并作用于PC12细胞12h后,miR-338-5p表达水平明显下调(p<0.01)。通过检测细胞活性和细胞凋亡率亦发现细胞活性明显降低(p<0.05)以及凋亡率明显增加(p<0.05)。因此,本研究后续实验采用300μM浓度并作用于PC12细胞12h以构建脊髓损伤后氧化应激细胞模型。通过检测细胞ROS,SOD水平发现miR-338-5p及其过表达外泌体均能明显提升PC12细胞受氧化应激刺激后的抗氧化能力。同时,western blot结果显示miR-338-5p exosomes能显著增加NF-M,GAP43的表达水平,而减少MAG,GFAP的表达水平,这与动物实验的结果一致。通过检测凋亡相关蛋白发现,miR-338-5p及其过表达外泌体能明显上调Bcl-2表达水平,而下调Bax和cleaved caspase3的表达水平,说明miR-338-5p及其过表达外泌体具有减轻细胞受氧化应激后发生凋亡的作用。通过双荧光素酶报告基因检测确定Cnr1是miR-338-5p的靶基因。Cnr1是G蛋白偶联受体之一,可以通过激活异三聚体Gi/o型G蛋白抑制腺苷酸环化酶活性并减少环腺苷酸(cyclic adenosine monophosphate,c AMP)的积累。过表达miR-338-5p通过负调控作用下调Cnr1,减少其对腺苷酸环化酶活性的抑制,增加c AMP的合成,进而激活其下游基因Rap1,通过Rap1介导其下游抗凋亡通路PI3K/Akt通路的激活,达到促进细胞增殖、存活和抗凋亡的作用。结论:过表达miR-338-5p修饰的BMSCs来源外泌体,能明显促进大鼠脊髓损伤后的神经运动功能恢复,并在继发性损伤阶段提供神经保护作用,改善神经细胞的生存环境。潜在的分子机制是miR-338-5p通过负调控靶基因Cnr1,促进腺苷酸环化酶活性,通过激活其下游基因Rap1介导的PI3K/Akt通路,达到促进神经细胞增殖、存活和抗凋亡的作用。"
干细胞移植治疗脊髓损伤的临床疗效评估：系统性评价和meta分析,彭文斌,"脊髓损伤造成患者的运动感觉障碍以及泌尿系统功能障碍,对患者本身的生活、工作以及寿命都影响极大,同时治疗费用和后期康复费用等花费巨大。由于致病因素不同、损伤时间不同及损伤程度不同导致的脊髓损伤后的治疗方式也不同,所以脊髓损伤后在选择治疗方式时需要综合考虑各种因素。随着干细胞移植技术的发展,干细胞移植的安全性以及其在治疗脊髓损伤动物模型中有一定的疗效。研究证实,干细胞移植治疗后,动物脊髓损伤模型的BBB评分有所改善,并且损伤部位出现一定的功能恢复。如今,干细胞移植治疗脊髓损伤也逐渐从动物实验向临床试验的方向发展,但是在各类临床试验中,因为选用的干细胞种类不同、移植细胞的方式和数量不同、治疗患者的脊髓损伤程度也不同,导致干细胞移植治疗脊髓损伤的治疗效果差别很大。因此,本研究采用meta分析方法对已发表的临床试验研究进行深入分析,以期为干细胞移植治疗脊髓损伤提供理论依据。方法:首先按照主题词和自由词,检索了Pubmed,Ovid Medline和Web of science数据库,删除重复文献。剩余文献根据纳入和排除标准对文献的摘要或者全文进行筛选,下载纳入的所有研究的全文。然后两名研究者按照制定的标准对纳入研究进行信息提取,采用Review Manage5.3统计软件对纳入的研究进行质量评价和异质性检验,对对照组和干细胞移植组的ASIA评分提高的患者人数占各组总数的百分比即有效率进行分析,以及对尿动力学指标以及不良反应进行系统性评价。结果:纳入的8篇文献异质性较低,质量评价风险为中等。ASIA评分有效率的OR值在无效线(即OR=1)的右侧,95%CI未包含无效线,表明干细胞移植组的ASIA评分有显著性提高(OR=7.55,95%CI:3.64-15.65,p<0.00001)。尿动力学指标显示在干细胞移植治疗后,脊髓损伤患者的膀胱功能有改善。治疗前受损程度的亚组中,ASIA评分等级为A的研究,表明干细胞移植组的ASIA评分有显著性提高(OR=6.87,95%CI:3.32-14.23,p<0.00001)。ASIA评分等级为B的研究,干细胞移植组和对照组的ASIA评分无差异(OR=9.78,95%CI:0.79-121.31,p=0.08)。移植的细胞总量亚组中,细胞量为n*10~6个的研究,干细胞移植组和对照组的ASIA评分无差异(OR=4.72,95%CI:0.86-26.04,p=0.07)。细胞量为n*10~7个和n*10~8个的研究,表明干细胞移植组的ASIA评分有显著性提高(OR=42.56,95%CI:4.92-368.26,p=0.0007)(OR=5.51,95%CI:1.74-17.44,p=0.004)。移植方式的亚组中,采用腰椎穿刺注射、脊髓损伤部位注射和囊性空腔包裹后静脉滴注进行干细胞移植治疗的研究,表明干细胞移植组的ASIA评分有显著性提高(OR=9.50,95%CI:2.24-40.21,p=0.002)(OR=10.43,95%CI:3.11-35.01,p=0.0001)(OR=5.20,95%CI:1.25-21.57,p=0.02)。移植细胞类型的亚组中,采用BM-MSCs、UC-MSCs和BM-mononuclears进行干细胞移植治疗的研究,表明干细胞移植组的ASIA评分有显著性提高(OR=7.56,95%CI:2.85-20.03,p<0.0001)(OR=45.00,95%CI:2.01-1006.75,p=0.02)(OR=5.20,95%CI:1.25-21.57,p=0.02)。采用h NSPCs进行干细胞移植治疗的研究,表明干细胞移植组和对照组的ASIA评分无差异(OR=5.00,95%CI:0.52-48.46,p=0.16)。结论:干细胞移植治疗脊髓损伤可以提高ASIA评分,改善感觉运动功能和膀胱功能。移植治疗前脊髓损伤程度越重,ASIA评分改善越明显。BM-MSCs,UC-MSCs和BM-mononuclears三种干细胞治疗后ASIA评分有提高,而h NSPCs治疗后ASIA评分无提高。细胞移植量大于10~7个治疗后ASIA评分提高明显。通过腰椎穿刺注射、注射到受损部位和囊性空腔包裹后静脉滴注三种移植方式移植干细胞治疗后均能观察到ASIA评分提高。"
3D打印构建新型药物传递系统的研究,李洋,"脊髓损伤发病率高,治愈率低,传统的药物治疗和手术治疗不能从根本上解决问题,也难以对功能进行区分恢复。采用组织工程的方式,移植载细胞的和营养物质的支架材料,可提供外源性细胞帮助恢复损伤处的生理功能,也可促进内源性神经元的修复,利于组织重建。目前支架移植治疗脊髓损伤的报道虽多,传统的支架移植也仅限于对脊髓损伤处缺陷的填埋,未对脊髓生理分区进行研究,而3D打印具有精准定制的特点可解决这类问题。本项研究拟采用3D打印构建新型药物传递系统:纳米粒-复合支架,制备载药纳米粒和新型可打印水凝胶,并负载细胞研究其体内、体外诱导细胞向神经元分化情况,实现脊髓损伤的治疗。第一章综述本章综述了脊髓损伤治疗方式、组织工程支架材料以及三维打印构建缓释支架三个方面。脊髓损伤的治疗方式包括药物治疗、手术治疗,其中药物治疗以抗炎,提供营养因子为主。随后介绍组织工程的支架材料,包括天然来源和人工合成。最后综述了三维打印构建缓释支架的应用研究。第二章PLGA载药纳米粒的制备与表征本章通过复乳法制备载BDNF的聚(乳酸-乙醇酸)共聚物纳米粒(BDNF@PLGA)。对牛血清白蛋白(BSA)、脑源性神经营养因子(BDNF)的检测方式进行方法学验证,精密度、回收率均满足方法学要求。以BSA为模型药物,采用正交设计优化其制备工艺,由单因素实验确定因素水平,以纳米粒的包封率、载药量为指标确定最佳工艺。实验结果表明,最佳制备条件:初乳和外水相的体积比为1:15,投药量与PLGA用量质量比为6:100,聚乙烯醇溶液浓度为1%(w/v),超声时间为5 min。在优化的条件下制备BDNF@PLGA纳米粒并对其进行表征,纳米粒近似球形,粒径为(215±0.28)nm,电位为-23.31 mV,包封率为(78.75±2.61)%。所得纳米粒可在体外缓释药物达14天,且无突释现象,达平衡时累积释放率为(84.65±3.35)%。第三章3D打印纳米粒-复合支架的制备及表征本章利用3D打印制备载BDNF纳米粒的海藻酸钙-Matrigel复合支架(BDNF-@PLGA-SA-MA)。打印材料由海藻酸钠和Matrigel混合构成,调整混合水凝的比例对黏度有较大改变,0.5%海藻酸钠-30%Matrigel(SA-MA)混合溶液的黏度适于打印,与3%CaCl_2溶液交联形成SA-MA支架,可符合凝胶倒置实验检测。在SA-MA支架中添加BDNF@PLGA,经3D打印机双通道打印可制备BDNF-@PLGA-SA-MA复合支架。扫描电镜下可观察到支架具有丰富的孔洞结构,纳米粒均匀分布于支架中,且类球形态保持完整。与载游离药物的SA-MA支架(BDNF-SA-MA)相比,BDNF@PLGA-SA-MA复合支架药物缓释能力更强。体外降解Alamar Blue染色结果表明,纳米粒复合支架具有促细胞增殖作用。钙黄绿素/碘化丙啶(Calcein/PI)色结果表明,纳米粒复合支架有较高的生物相容性,培养三天后细胞的存活率为(88.04±3.10)%。第四章3D打印纳米粒-复合支架体外诱导外胚层间充质干细胞向神经元分化本章主要研究3D打印的BDNF@PLGA-SA-MA复合支架在体外的应用,考察支架促外胚层间充质干细胞(EMSCs)向神经元分化的能力,同时以二维培养及载游离药物的BDNF-SA-MA支架做对照组。免疫荧光结果表明上述培养环境下,EMSCs均可表达特异性神经元标记物,诱导后从细胞形态上看,BDNF@PLGA-SA-MA复合支架上的神经元更成熟,可形成神经网络。qRT-PCR检测目的基因mRNA的相对表达含量,纳米粒复合支架中EMSCs的mRNA表达含量更高。流式细胞术检测TUJ1的表达量,发现纳米粒复合支架中的EMSCs阳性率更高。三维环境可模拟细胞外基质作用,包载纳米粒可减少BDNF的流失,缓慢释放药物诱导细胞分化,使EMSCs向神经元分化效率更高。第五章3D打印纳米粒-复合支架修复脊髓损伤的研究本章主要考察载EMSCs的BDNF@PLGA-SA-MA复合支架体内修复大鼠脊髓损伤。SD大鼠进行T9-T10脊髓全截断造模,移植载细胞的复合支架进行治疗,评价运动功能的恢复包括BBB评分和旷场实验;研究结果表明:损伤后前四周载游离药物的BDNF-SA-MA支架和BDNF@PLGA-SA-MA复合支架大鼠的恢复能力均较好,且BDNF@PLGA-SA-MA支架对运动功能恢复更明显。病理切片结果显示,经BDNF@PLGA-SA-MA支架移植修复后,损伤空洞减少,胞间隙明显缩小,排列有序,组织发生有利重构。"
超微粒径阳离子碳量子点介导的神经干细胞定向分化神经元及体内脊髓损伤修复研究,邵凤霞,"利用外源性或内源性神经干细胞(neural stem cell,NSCs)来进行脊髓损伤(spinal cord injury,SCI)修复一直是一项世界级难题,这主要是因为处于损伤部位复杂微环境的神经干细胞倾向于分化为星形胶质细胞而不是神经元,分化的星形胶质细胞及其分泌物还可进一步形成胶质瘢痕,构成神经再生的物理和化学屏障。虽然目前已有多种策略可在损伤区域实现神经元的定向分化,但采用超微粒径阳离子碳量子点(cationic carbon quantum dots,CQDs)诱导NSCs定向分化为神经元,以此来促进脊髓损伤修复的研究尚未见报道。本课题首次研究了阳离子碳量子点除了依赖于其光学性质(如生物标记和生物成像等)和阳离子性质(如基因治疗和药物输送等)外对细胞分化命运的影响。本研究以枸杞寡糖(Lycium barbarum L.oligosaccharide,LBOS)为碳源,乙二胺和PEI为阳离子试剂,通过一步水热合成法制备出了超微粒径的阳离子碳量子点(~1nm)。体外实验表明,超微粒径的阳离子碳量子点可显著抑制NSCs向星形胶质细胞分化,并在不影响神经元分化的基础上,促进神经元向周围区域的延伸。体内实验表明,超微粒径阳离子碳量子点可在脊髓全横断损伤区域显著抑制内源性及外源性NSCs向星形胶质细胞分化,进而抑制胶质瘢痕增生,促进神经回路重建。综上所述,本研究通过体外及体内实验充分表明枸杞寡糖来源的超微粒径阳离子碳量子点可显著抑制NSCs向星形胶质细胞分化,从而指导神经干细胞定向分化为神经元。第一章综述本章以脊髓损伤为重点,着重介绍了脊髓损伤后损伤区域的病理性变化、脊髓损伤模型的构建、脊髓损伤的治疗方法以及最终治疗效果的评价。接着,围绕研究主体碳量子点的制备方法、光学性质及应用领域作简单介绍。在这个过程中,我们发现到目前为止,尚没有相关报道表明超微粒径阳离子碳量子点具有促神经干细胞定向分化神经元的作用。最后,提出本课题的设计思路及研究意义,为论文后续工作的开展奠定基础。第二章枸杞寡糖的提取纯化及初步表征本章主要介绍了碳量子点的碳源LBOS的提取纯化工艺和初步表征结果,即通过水提醇沉法、Seveg法、多级柱层析法从中药枸杞子中提纯枸杞寡糖,并借助高效凝胶渗透色谱、考马斯亮蓝蛋白含量检测、质谱及单糖组成检测对枸杞寡糖的纯度、分子量及单糖组成进行初步表征。结果表明,最终纯化得到的LBOS分子量分布集中,约为5个D-半乳糖所构成的寡糖,几乎不含残留蛋白和小分子杂质。第三章碳量子点的制备及表征本章以枸杞寡糖为碳源,乙二胺和PEI为阳离子试剂,通过一步水热合成法制备出了超微粒径的阳离子碳量子点,并通过紫外-可见光吸收光谱、荧光激发和发射光谱、红外光谱、琼脂糖凝胶电泳及高分辨透射电镜对碳量子点的光学性能、电荷性质及粒径大小进行表征。结果表明,本研究所制备得到的碳量子点是一种粒径低至1 nm左右的超微碳量子点,表面带有正电荷,可在不同波长激发光下发出不同颜色的荧光,即CQDs的荧光发射波长具有激发波长依赖性。第四章碳量子点体外介导神经干细胞定向分化神经元研究本章以枸杞寡糖为对照,以GFAP(星形胶质细胞标记)、Tuj1(未成熟神经元标记)、MAP2(成熟神经元标记)为指标通过免疫荧光法和Western Blot法检测超微粒径阳离子碳量子点在体外作用于神经干细胞后对神经干细胞分化方向的影响。最终结果显示,与对照组LBOS相比,以LBOS为碳源所制备的碳量子点可显著抑制NSCs向星形胶质细胞分化,并在不影响神经元分化的基础上,促进神经元向周围区域的延伸。接着,为了探究碳量子点制备过程中使用两种阳离子试剂的必要性,分别使用去离子水替代乙二胺或PEI,在相同的操作条件下制备得到了PEICQDs及乙二胺-CQDs,将这两种碳量子点作用于神经干细胞后,乙二胺-CQDs对神经干细胞的分化方向没有明显影响,PEI-CQDs则表现出明显的细胞毒性。这一结果充分表明使用两种阳离子试剂对修饰碳量子点的必要性。第五章碳量子点介导NSCs定向分化神经元的初步机制探究本章将碳量子点作用于高表达GFAP的星形胶质细胞来检测碳量子点对GFAP表达水平的影响,从而间接揭示碳量子点抑制NSCs分化为星形胶质细胞的潜在作用机制。具体而言,将碳量子点作用于高表达GFAP的星形胶质细胞8天后,通过免疫荧光染色来观察碳量子点对细胞中GFAP和β-tubulin表达水平的影响,其中β-tubulin作为细胞骨架蛋白,其表达范围和表达水平可反映细胞的生存状态,进而反映碳量子点对星形胶质细胞的毒性作用。结果显示,随着碳量子作用浓度的升高,越来越多的星形胶质细胞低表达或不表达GFAP,与此同时却对β-tubulin的表达没有明显影响。根据这一现象推测阳离子碳量子点进入星形胶质细胞后可特异性的与带负电的GFAP结合,影响GFAP的组装或解聚,从而抑制GFAP的表达水平。基于这一原因,我们推测当碳量子点作用于神经干细胞后,进入NSCs中的碳量子点将会特异性的结合神经干细胞趋向分化时初始表达的GFAP,影响GFAP的组装,从而影响神经干细胞向星形胶质细胞的分化。第六章碳量子点体内介导脊髓损伤修复研究本章通过碳量子点对大鼠全横断脊髓损伤模型的修复效果来评价碳量子点在体内指导神经干细胞分化的能力。具体而言,将包埋有碳量子点及外源性神经干细胞的纤维蛋白支架作用于全横断脊髓损伤大鼠并使其修复两个月后,以旷场轨迹实验和组织学染色来评价大鼠运动功能的恢复程度和损伤区神经元的再生状况。结果表明,在脊髓损伤处联合使用碳量子点和外源性神经干细胞时,碳量子点可明显诱导内源性和外源性神经干细胞向神经元分化,并实现损伤脊髓两端神经元的相互连接,为神经冲动的传导奠定细胞基础。更为重要的是,在其他各组大鼠后肢仍处于拖拽运动时,联合使用碳量子点和外源性神经干细胞进行治疗的大鼠,已可以实现短距离内后肢的协调步态行走。"
骨髓间充质干细胞来源的外泌体通过TSG-6通路促进脊髓损伤修复的作用及机制研究,董万亮,"脊髓损伤(Spinal Cord Injury,SCI)是脊髓由于外力撞击、压迫等直接或间接因素造成的一种严重的神经损伤性疾病。SCI常在脊髓原发性损伤的基础上,继发缺血、水肿、缺氧、炎症反应、钙超载等病理过程,导致运动功能丧失和SCI后相应节段下的感觉异常[1]。运动功能的丧失以及感觉异常,严重的影响了患者的生存质量,并给患者的家庭带来了沉重的经济负担。目前该病发病率呈逐年上升的趋势[2],且针对脊髓损伤尚无十分有效的治疗方法,大部分治疗以对症治疗为主,因此临床上急需可以改善脊髓损伤后病情的发展和预后的新的治疗方法。近年来,干细胞的生物治疗逐渐引起人们的关注,并在再生医学领域的研究和临床治疗中得到广泛的应用。间充质干细胞(Mesenchymal stem cells,MSCs)是一类具有自我更新能力和多项分化潜能的成体干细胞,它来源广泛,且具有低免疫原性的特点,是组织工程修复的理想移植物。MSCs作为公认的抗炎症反应屏障,是目前SCI细胞移植治疗的最佳选择。大量的文献报道显示MSCs移植在SCI的治疗中有着积极的效应。研究发现,MSCs不仅可以抑制SCI后损伤局部的炎症反应和细胞凋亡情况,还可以促进损伤处轴突及血管的生成;也有文献发现,MSCs可以减少星形细胞疤痕和组织空洞,促进运动功能恢复,但具体机制尚不清楚。在MSCs的临床应用中,存在着细胞移植后存活率低,疗效不稳定等问题。而MSCs上清中提取的外泌体治疗SCI有很大优势,外泌体在血液、培养基中更加稳定,利于保存,易于质量管理,更加安全、体积小不易堵塞血管,不会诱发或者产生肿瘤,它是纳米级载体,可以有选择地到达炎症部位。外泌体是细胞外小泡的一种,在细胞与细胞间的通讯中起着重要作用,MSCs上清中提取的外泌体治疗SCI是通过基因信息和交换蛋白的方式为解决这些问题提供了新思路,促进细胞间的信息交流。外泌体在自然界中的来源及其分布比较广泛,大多数哺乳动物当中都可以分泌,在各种体液中也存在分布,不同的细胞分泌的外泌体有差异,尤其在发生疾病时,正常细胞分泌的外泌体和病态分泌的外泌体成分差别很大。因此对提高MSCs来源的外泌体治疗效果具有重要意义。肿瘤坏死因子α刺激基因-6(Tumor necrosis factor α stimulated gene 6,TSG-6)编码的分泌性蛋白是一种保护性的炎症反应因子,它通过与透明质酸、硫酸软骨素或蛋白多糖结合,介导炎症细胞迁移、黏附与免疫调节和细胞外基质重塑,进而发挥炎症调控作用[3]。重组TSG-6蛋白已应用于多种疾病模型的研究,并表现出了有效的抗炎作用。最近的研究发现,重组人TSG-6局部应用可减轻多种疾病的炎症反应和病理表现[4]。而TSG-6已被证明可在MSCs中表达,并在MSCs移植治疗一些疾病中,发挥了重要作用[5]。因此,明确TSG-6是否在MSCs来源的外泌体移植治疗中发挥关键作用,并以此为基础对MSCs来源的外泌体进行修饰,提高MSCs来源的外泌体移植治疗SCI的效果,对于临床MSCs来源的外泌体移植治疗SCI,有着指导意义。第一部分 骨髓间充质干细胞来源的外泌体对脊髓损伤的影响目的外泌体(exosomes)是近年来新发现的细胞与细胞相互作用的重要手段。它们是纳米级小囊泡(30-150纳米),内含复杂的RNA和蛋白质,可以通过膜受体和其他方式结合到靶细胞。外泌体参与生物信息的调节;各种细胞在正常和病理条件下都能分泌外泌体。外泌体主要来源于细胞内溶酶体微粒形成的多胞体,通过多胞外膜与细胞膜融合释放到细胞外基质中。大量研究表明,移植的间充质干细胞来源的外泌体具有良好的治疗效果,在神经系统损伤的修复中起着关键作用。在该研究中,分离来自骨髓间充质干细胞(BMSCs)的外泌体并通过尾静脉移植到大鼠SCI模型中。观察移植前后大鼠SCI模型的行为学和组织学变化,初步观察尾静脉注射BMSCs外泌体对SCI的治疗作用。方法1.从大鼠骨髓中原代分离骨髓间充质干细胞(BMSCs);2.采集BMSCs细胞培养上清液。用试剂盒提取外泌体。并利用透射电镜观察外泌体的形态。蛋白质印迹法鉴定外泌体表面标记蛋白;3.将30只大鼠随机分为三组,每组分别10只:假手术组、手术对照组和外泌体组。外泌体组大鼠术后1h静脉注射500μl外泌体,手术对照组大鼠术后1h静脉注射500 μl无菌磷酸盐溶液。4.通过BBB评分法和斜板实验评估术后各组大鼠的运动功能;5.通过Nissl染色、HE染色和LFB染色观察脊髓组织形态。结果1.透射电镜结果显示,上清中提取的外泌体,显示出大量具有圆形或椭圆形形状的囊泡状结构。囊泡周围的膜结构明显。尺寸相对均匀,直径约为40-100nm。2.Western Blot检测结果显示CD9和CD63呈阳性,鉴定提取物,确定其为外泌体。3.各组大鼠术前行为学评分均位于正常水平。术后外泌体组以及手术对照组BBB评分和斜板评分均明显低于假手术组(p<0.05)。外泌体注射7天后,外泌体组的BBB评分以及斜板评分高于手术对照组(p<0.05),且差异具有统计学意义。4.移植后D28结果显示,Nissl染色、HE染色和LFB染色发现假手术组的脊髓形态结构正常,手术对照组大鼠体内Nissl体减少,炎性细胞浸润,髓鞘丢失明显。与手术对照组相比,外泌体组脊髓组织内Nissl体增多,炎性细胞浸润减少,髓质减少,减少了鞘层损耗。结论骨髓间充质干细胞来源的外泌体可以减轻脊髓损伤后的组织损伤程度,促进神经运动功能的恢复。第二部分 骨髓间充质干细胞来源的外泌体治疗脊髓损伤的基因表达谱分析目的本研究中我们制作大鼠脊髓损伤模型后利用转录组测序技术,建立大鼠脊髓损伤及骨髓间充质干细胞来源的外泌体治疗的基因表达谱分析。在转录组测序中,可以通过将读数的数量映射到基因区域来估计基因表达水平,但读数的数量不仅与基因表达水平成正比,而且与基因本身的长度和测序数据的数量成正比。为了使不同基因和不同样品之间的基因表达水平相当,将读数转化为FPKM(每百万映射读数的外显子模型的片段每千克碱基)以标准化基因表达。方法SD大鼠(SPF级),戊巴比妥钠腹腔注射麻醉后,利用美国PSI公司,型号IH-0400撞机仪制作大鼠脊髓损伤的模型,20g的撞击棒,在4.5cm处自由落体撞击T10椎体层面脊髓中央,造模成功的标志性为,大鼠双下肢抽搐,尾巴甩向一侧,出现双下肢的瘫痪。从损伤脊髓中提取总RNA,以脊髓中心为中点,上5mm,下5mm。采用转录组测序技术扫描总RNA,获得脊髓损伤后大鼠差异mRNA表达谱从。大鼠骨髓中原代分离骨髓间充质干细胞(MSCs);采集MSCs细胞培养上清液。用试剂盒提取外泌体。并利用透射电镜观察外泌体的形态。蛋白质印迹法鉴定外泌体表面标记蛋白;将12只大鼠随机分为四组,每组分别3只:假手术组、手术对照组、骨髓间充质干细胞组和外泌体组。外泌体组大鼠术后1 h静脉注射500 μl外泌体,手术对照组术后1h静脉注射500 μl无菌磷酸盐溶液,骨髓间充质干细胞组大鼠术后1 h静脉注射500 μ1骨髓间充质干细胞。并于术后24h,通过透射电镜观察外泌体在脊髓组织中的分布情况;成功建立大鼠脊髓损伤模型,并对提取的总RNA进行质量评价,质量可靠。采用转录组测序技术获得脊髓损伤后大鼠mRNA的差异表达谱。观察差异性表达基因数目,并制作基因聚类分析热图。结果通过差异基因筛选并文献查阅,从中选定TSG-6基因进一步研究,测序结果显示,TSG-6在手术对照组中表达比假手术组显著降低;脊髓损伤大鼠经外泌体治疗后,该基因表达水平较手术对照组增高,低于假手术组。结论TSG-6在手术对照组和假手术之间表达有差异;而且治疗组和手术对照组之间存在差异。通过转录组测序,假手术组、手术对照组、外泌体组和骨髓间充质干细胞组之间存在基因表达水平差异。根据基因表达差异和GO功能分析及KEGG信号通路分析,结合文献阅读,选定TSG-6基因与神经损伤相关。第三部分 TSG-6在骨髓间充质干细胞来源的外泌体治疗脊髓损伤中的关键作用目的本研究通过沉默和高表达MSCs来源的外泌体中的TSG-6基因,并将其外泌体注射给SCI大鼠。观察注射前后大鼠脊髓损伤模型的行为学和组织学变化。确定TSG-6在脊髓损伤治疗中的作用。方法1.从大鼠骨髓中纯化并培养MSCs,慢病毒沉默和高表达MSCs中的TSG-6基因和鉴定,提取外泌体。将75只雄性SD大鼠分为五组,每组分别15只:假手术组,手术对照组,外泌体组,TSG-6沉默组,TSG-6高表达组。术后24h进行大鼠灌注,观察外泌体在脊髓组织中的定位和分布。其他大鼠在术后1,3,7,14和D28测试运动能力和行为的变化。同时在术后D28,通过组织切片染色观察损伤处组织形态的变化。2.术后24h观察外泌体在脊髓损伤处分布。术后D28,通过Nissl染色,HE染色和Luxol fast blue(LFB)染色观察脊髓的形态学变化。3.沉默TSG-6基因,并将其外泌体注射给SCI大鼠,通过BBB评分和术后各时间点的斜板实验评分观察各组神经损伤的恢复情况。4.高表达TSG-6基因,并将其外泌体注射给SCI大鼠,通过BBB评分和术后各时间点的斜板实验评分观察各组神经损伤的恢复情况。结果1.荧光显微镜观察慢病毒转染效果。采用聚合酶链反应(PCR)和蛋白质印迹(Western blot)检测转染效果。结果显示MSCs内TSG-6基因沉默和高表达成功;2.外泌体组和TSG-6高表达组大鼠脊髓损伤后BBB评分和斜板评分均显著高于手术对照组(p<0.05),而TSG-6沉默组与手术对照组相比无显著统计学差异。脊髓损伤后第7天TSG-6高表达组BBB评分以及斜板评分均高于外泌体组(p<0.05)。3.移植后D28结果显示,Nissl染色、HE染色和LFB染色发现假手术组的脊髓形态结构正常,手术对照组和TSG-6沉默组大鼠体内Nissl体减少,炎性细胞浸润,髓鞘丢失明显。与手术对照组相比,外泌体组和TSG-6高表达组脊髓组织内Nissl体增多,炎性细胞浸润减少,髓质减少,减少了鞘层损耗。且TSG-6高表达组优于外泌体组。结论MSCs来源的外泌体可以降低脊髓损伤后组织损伤程度,促进神经运动功能的恢复,为生物移植治疗脊髓损伤提供了新的方向和思路。但是高表达TSG-6的MSCs来源的外泌体显示具有更强的治疗效果,TSG-6在MSCs来源的外泌体治疗脊髓损伤中发挥着重要的作用。"
碳点介导的二维及三维细胞神经转分化研究,陈嘉欣,"病毒载体存在诱发基因突变的风险,而非病毒纳米基因载体具有优异的安全性,因此相关研究受到关注。近年来,不少研究报道了应用阳离子化多糖作为基因载体携载特定基因进行细胞重编程。多糖具有良好的安全性和低细胞毒性,因此多糖来源的阳离子化碳点,不仅可实现安全的基因传递,碳点自身的荧光性能可将基因传递的过程可视化。阳离子化碳点有望开发为兼具基因传递与生物成像功能的新型非病毒纳米基因载体。然而目前尚未有利用碳点作为非病毒纳米基因载体应用于诱导细胞神经定向分化的研究,因此本课题以天然紫菜多糖为碳源,乙二胺为阳离子化试剂和表面钝化剂,通过水热法制备带正电荷的碳点,并对碳点进行表征和基因载体性能的考察。在此基础上,以碳点作为非病毒纳米基因载体,将Ascl1、Brn2、Sox2质粒以不同的质粒组合导入外胚层间充质干细胞,进行细胞的定向神经诱导,体外获得神经细胞,为由损伤或疾病引起的神经元损伤的治疗提供种子细胞。此外,细胞的体内生长环境是三维体系,与一般的体外二维培养体系存在巨大差异,因此体外利用组织工程材料进行细胞的三维培养能最大程度模拟体内环境,为细胞体内移植奠定研究基础。对于由外力冲击造成的神经损伤,如脊髓损伤,损伤部位形成缺口,需要生物相容性好且有利于细胞粘附、增殖和迁移的组织工程支架携载细胞移植到缺损部位进行损伤的修复治疗,良好的组织工程支架能够抑制细胞凋亡和组织损伤引起的炎症反应,为神经再生提供良好的环境。为此本课题以海藻酸钠和明胶为原料,通过调节不同的配方制备适合诱导性神经细胞生长的水凝胶,为后续将优化的水凝胶携载诱导性神经细胞移植至大鼠脊髓半横断部位进行脊髓损伤修复提供初步研究基础。第一章综述本章主要阐述了碳点的制备方法、理化性质以及目前的应用,重点介绍碳点优异的理化性质以及在生物成像的应用,为碳点作为多功能非病毒纳米基因载体的应用提供可行性参考;同时简单介绍目前体外获取神经细胞的方法,包括多能干细胞的定向分化和体细胞重编程,为利用碳点携载特定质粒进行间充质干细胞转染提供依据;介绍目前用于治疗脊髓损伤的生物支架,为支架材料的选择提供参考;最后提出课题的选题依据和思路,为论文工作的开展奠定基础。第二章碳点的制备及表征本章采用紫菜多糖为原料,乙二胺作为阳离子修饰剂,通过水热法制备阳离子化碳点。通过测定紫外-可见吸收光谱、荧光发射和激发光谱以及荧光量子产率,对碳点的荧光性能进行考察,红外光谱和含氮量的测定说明了碳点的表面修饰和结构组成。本课题制备得到的碳点具有激发光波长依赖性荧光性质,在不同的激发光下显示红色,绿色和蓝色三种荧光,碳点表面经阳离子化修饰,荧光量子产率高达56.3%,具有优异的光学性能。第三章碳点的基因载体性能研究本章主要围绕碳点的基因载体性能展开研究。通过琼脂糖凝胶电泳考察阳离子化碳点对质粒DNA结合能力,碳点与质粒DNA以10:1的比例混合即可对DNA进行有效的结合。通过测定自组装纳米粒的粒径、Zeta电位和扫描电镜,对碳点/pDNA自组装纳米粒进行表征,结果显示碳点的平均粒约径为4 nm,自主装纳米粒约为14 nm,碳点和自组装纳米粒均带正电荷,呈规则的球形,分散性好。此外,考察自组装纳米粒的毒性和细胞转运机制,与市售的阳离子转染试剂相比,自主装纳米粒的毒性更低,几乎无细胞毒性;自组装纳米粒通过小窝蛋白和网格蛋白介导的内吞作用进入细胞,发挥基因传递的作用。第四章碳点/pDNA纳米粒介导EMSCs向神经细胞定向分化研究本章以碳点作为基因载体,分别与由Ascl1、Brn2、Sox2组成的7组质粒组合自组装形成纳米粒,进行外胚层间充质干细胞(EMSCs)的转染。通过观察细胞形态变化,ELISA和Western blot测定特定神经蛋白的表达,确定最优的转染组合;经免疫荧光,免疫组化和RT-PCR鉴定诱导获得的神经样细胞。结果显示,由Ascl1和Brn2组成的AB组合可更有效的诱导EMSCs向神经元样细胞分化,诱导获得的神经元样细胞表达Tuj1,Map2,Tau,Gap-43和NF200;最后RT-PCR显示,与市售的阳离子转染试剂相比,碳点的细胞转染效率更高,具有显著性差异。第五章三维培养体系的初步探索本章以海藻酸钠和明胶为原料,以CaCl_2为促凝剂,制备复合水凝胶。通过测定凝胶时间和细胞毒性,对45组水凝胶的凝胶性质和生物相容性进行初步评价。接着,测定水凝胶的吸水率,溶胀率和降解速率,考察水凝胶的物理性质,进一步筛选出最佳水凝胶配方。最后将转染后的EMSCs与复合水凝胶混合成胶,制备载细胞水凝胶。观察不同培养时间水凝胶上细胞的存活和生长情况,比较二维和三维细胞神经转分化效率,初步考察水凝胶是否适宜细胞生长,为后续载细胞水凝胶的体内移植提供研究基础。"
骨髓间充质干细胞通过TLR4/MyD88缓解脊髓损伤神经病理性痛,薛博涵,"背景与目的脊髓损伤(Spinal Cord Injury,SCI)是一种严重的中枢神经系统的损伤,是目前公认的疑难病之一,它具有致残率高、医疗耗费高等特点,既严重威胁了患者的健康,同时也极大影响了患者的生活质量,给家庭以及社会带来了沉重的经济负担。流行病学研究表明,中国每年大约有10万名患者。SCI后常常伴随着疼痛的发生,国际规定将SCI后疼痛分为感受性疼痛,神经性疼痛以及其它疼痛,其中感受性疼痛发病率为50%,神经性疼痛发病率为59%。在所有的类型的疼痛中,神经病理性痛(Neuropathic Pain,NP)最常见也最难治愈,药物是脊髓损伤后神经病理性痛(Neuropathic Pain After Spinal Crod Injury,SCI-NP)目前主要的治疗方法,但是副作用大,大约只有1/3的患者能减轻50%的疼痛。近年来,以骨髓间充质干细胞(Mesenchymal Stem Cells,MSCs)为代表的成体干细胞移植治疗SCI被给予了厚望,并在临床得到了初步应用,而MSCs对SCI-NP的影响研究甚少且存在争议,因此研究MSCs移植对SCI-NP的影响以及如果去影响就显得尤为必要。国内外部分研究表明,SCI后移植MSCs可以缓解机械性痛和热痛敏,阻止慢性痛的产生和发展。然而干细胞移植对缓解疼痛的效果也一直存在争议。Hofstetter等将野生型的NSCs移植SCI-NP大鼠时发现移植后大鼠运动功能提高的同时,其前肢出现痛觉超敏。因此深入探讨MSCs移植对SCI-NP的影响,以及其发挥作用的分子机制是本实验研究的主旨。Toll样受体4(Toll-like receptor4,TLR4)是一种模式识别受体目前已经证明与免疫性或炎症性疾病有着密切的关系,其激活后可通过调控NF-κB信号途径生成并释放大量的促炎因子。研究表明,在中枢神经系统,TLR4主要表达在小胶质细胞,参与小胶质细胞的活化,并在中枢免疫炎症过程中起着重要的作用,Sorge RE等表明,TLR4与炎性痛以及NP密切相关。MSCs被誉为对抗过度炎性反应的“监护人”,那么MSCs移植SCI-NP是否能够通过降低TLR4的表达,从而减轻SCI后慢性炎症和损伤所导致的痛觉过敏,目前仍未见报道,因此,本研究首先通过meta分析,评价MSCs移植对SCI-NP的影响,并在此基础上,通过在损伤处原位移植MSCs,观察移植前后SCI-NP模型大鼠组织学、行为学变化的规律,评估其移植缓解疼痛的效果,探讨MSCs移植缓解SCI-NP大鼠疼痛的机制,为SCI-NP的MSCs移植治疗提供理论依据和实验基础。方法1.以""MSCs"",""Spinal cord injury""和""Neuropathic pain""为关键词,搜索文献,通过meta分析对MSCs对SCI-NP的影响进行评价,分析课题的可行性;2.设立100kdynes,150kdynes,180kdynes,200kdynes四组不同的打击力度,于术前1d,术后7d、14d、21d和28d检测大鼠机械痛阈的变化,同时在术前1d,术后1d、3d、5d、7d、14d、21d和28d检测大鼠BBB评分以及斜板实验的变化,确定最佳打击力度;3.以最佳打击力度建立SCI-NP模型,于术前1d,术后7d、14d、21d和28d检测大鼠机械痛阈的变化,同时检测术前1d,术后1d、3d、5d、7d、14d、21d和28d大鼠BBB评分和斜板实验的变化,免疫荧光(immunofluorescence,IF)和免疫印迹实验(Western blot,WB)检测SCI后胶质细胞激活以及TLR4、My D88、p-p38和p-NF-κB p65等相关分子表达的变化。ELISA检测细胞因子IL-6和TNF-α表达的变化,HE染色和髓鞘染色检测损伤处组织病理学改变;4.体外培养SD大鼠原代MSCs,并取P2代细胞,通过流式细胞术鉴定其表面抗原CD34,CD45,CD44,CD90的表达,对原代培养的MSCs进行鉴定;5.建立SCI-NP模型,并于术后7d,原位移植MSCs,检测移植前后大鼠机械痛阈及运动功能的变化,并通过IF检测小胶质细胞激活情况,WB检测TLR4、My D88、p-p38和p-NF-κB p65等分子表达的变化。ELISA检测细胞因子IL-6和TNF-α表达的变化。结果1.Meta分析的结果显示,MSCs移植能够缓解SCI后的机械痛敏,但是对热痛敏无缓解作用,MSCs移植的最佳时间点为SCI后7d。2.打击力度的摸索结果显示,以100kdynes和150kdynes的打击力度建模,均未能产生NP,而以180kdynes和200kdynes的打击力度建模,均能够产生NP,但200kdynes的打击力度建模,机械痛阈下降的时间比180kdynes早,BBB评分以及斜板实验的结果显示,两种打击力度建模,其运动功能并无明显的差异,因此200kdynes为最佳打击力度,并为后续实验所用的打击力度。3.以200kdynes打击力度建模后,大鼠双后肢的机械痛阈在7d时即出现明显的下降,21d后逐渐稳定,疼痛的持续时间超过28d。BBB评分结果显示,SCI后1d大鼠BBB评分为下降为0,随着损伤的进程,运动功能逐渐恢复,BBB评分逐渐升高,于14d逐渐达到稳定,但仍不能恢复到正常值。斜板实验结果显示,SCI后,大鼠的支撑角度明显下调,随着损伤的进程,逐渐恢复,但仍不能恢复到正常值。4.SCI后24h,损伤处受压变形,局部充血,伴随着损伤进程,大量炎性细胞浸润,并伴有脊髓空洞和脱髓鞘的发生。损伤处星形胶质细胞和小胶质细胞激活,且小胶质细胞中TLR4,My D88,p-p38,p-NF-κBp65表达上调;血清中IL-6和TNF-α的水平在24h即开始上调,持续时间超过28d。5.体外原代培养MSCs,流式细胞术结果显示,所培养的细胞细胞CD90,CD44表达为阳性,阳性率分别为99.7%和86.5%;CD34,CD45表达为阴性,证明所培养细胞为MSCs。6.术后7d移植MSCs结果显示,MSCs移植后,与Vehicle组相比,大鼠双后肢机械痛有明显的缓解。而BBB评分和斜板实验结果显示,MSCs移植在短期内对运动功能无影响;分子实验结果显示,MSCs移植后TLR4,My D88,p-p38,p-NF-κB p65的表达明显下调,同时血清中IL-6和TNF-α表达下调。结论MSCs移植能够通过抑制TLR4/My D88信号通路,下调IL-6和TNF-α的表达,减轻神经炎症从而缓解SCI-NP。"
人骨髓间充质干细胞与人脂肪间充质干细胞在修复脊髓损伤中的比较研究,周治来,"脊髓损伤(Spinal cord injury, SCI)是中枢神经系统(Central nervous system, CNS)的一种严重创伤,是人类致残的重要原因之一,全球每年新增140000例SCI患者,我国2002年北京地区SCI发生率为60/百万人口。SCI可导致损伤平面以下不同程度瘫痪,而且SCI主要发生在青壮年人群中,从SCI中存活下来的患者其生活质量严重下降,给家庭、社会带来沉重的负担。随着近年我国工农业生产方式的改变及医疗抢救网络建设的相对滞后,我国面临SCI救治的现状十分严峻。鉴于SCI的高致残率及产生的严重社会负担,寻求SCI新的有效治疗方法成为目前研究热点。 SCI后病理生理变化与发病机制极为复杂。首先,脊髓由于机械性外伤导致组织撕裂、扭曲、压迫等,伴随着脊髓局部血循环障碍,出血、局部缺血、水肿、炎症等进一步使脊髓细胞死亡。脊髓再生微环境恶化,局部轴突抑制因子产生,局部神经递质浓度改变,尤其是钙超载使脊髓白质中的轴突变性,这些变化持续数天,称之为初次损伤；损伤不止于此,初次损伤可以激活体内一系列细胞内信号改变,其中一个重要的变化是星形胶质细胞过度活化,分泌产生致密的胶质瘢痕,抑制轴突再生。与此同时,由于损伤导致血脑屏障破坏,外周血的中性粒细胞、巨噬细胞等浸润至损伤局部,与脊髓内部的小胶质细胞协同进一步破坏脊髓再生环境,抑制轴突再生。为减轻SCI给患者带来的伤害,学者们探讨了诸多SCI的治疗方法,包括：药物治疗、神经营养因子、基因治疗和细胞移植等。 随着干细胞领域研究的深入,干细胞移植被证实是修复SCI十分有希望的手段。已有多种类型的干细胞被尝试应用于不同动物SCI模型甚至Ⅰ、Ⅱ期临床试验中。理论上,由囊胚的内细胞层分离而来的胚胎干细胞,可跨胚层分化,具有万向分化潜能(pluripotency),是移植的最佳选择,但由于受伦理学限制及潜在的致畸性与致瘤性,其应用前景受限；CNS干细胞分化能力强,但在神经发育过程中数量逐渐减少而且传代后细胞易老化,同时也受伦理学限制,影响其临床应用；诱导多能干细胞由于其技术要求较高,难以获取足够数量的细胞；雪旺细胞与嗅鞘细胞移植疗效较好,但取材难度大,难以扩增出足够的细胞量,不适于临床应用。成体间充质干细胞(Mesenchymal stem cells,MSCs)来源广泛,取材方便,不受伦理学限制,并可经过改造,成为一个良好的载体,有望成为临床移植修复SCI良好的细胞来源。 自从发现MSCs后,人们即尝试移植MSCs修复CNS损伤疾病模型,其中MSCs移植治疗SCI动物模型已近二十年。大量文献报道取得部分令人鼓舞的结果,但在动物实验中,MSCs移植修复仍无突破性成果。究其原因,除SCI本身病理生理变化极端复杂,单纯MSCs移植难以对抗所有的病理变化之外,结合参考文献,我们认为还存在以下原因：(1) MSCs修复SCI的机制尚未阐释清楚。诚然,动物实验中MSCs移植修复SCI疗效肯定,临床Ⅰ、Ⅱ期试验进一步提示MSCs可用于移植治疗SCI。但其修复机制是细胞替代?营养因子?抗凋亡?抗炎症?目前尚无确切回答；(2) MSCs的来源问题。MSCs最早是从骨髓中分离获取,即骨髓间充质干细胞(Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell,BMSC),目前关于MSCs移植修复各种疾病模型大都也是以BMSC完成的。但培养BMSC需抽取大量的骨髓(约100m1),有一定的风险,包括感染、疼痛等,而且BMSC传至7-8代后细胞易老化,其分泌营养因子功能下降。究竟哪一种MSCs是最适合移植修复SCI,目前仍无可靠的数据供参考,这也是本研究考虑的重点。(3)MSCs的跨胚层分化问题。MSCs作为中胚层来源的细胞,不但能骨、软骨、脂肪等细胞转化,已有研究报道,MSCs在体内及体外均拥有向神经外胚层细胞(神经元、星形胶质细胞等)转化的能力。是否有必要在移植前对MSCs进行神经诱导,目前仍存在争议。 鉴于分离培养BMSC面临如上所述的困难,寻求MSCs另一种可靠的来源就显得格外重要。为此,人们进行了广泛的探索。包括：脐带间充质干细胞、脐血间充质干细胞、胎盘间充质干细胞、脂肪间充质干细胞等。在众多的MSCs中,由于脂肪组织来源广泛、易于获取、无伦理学限制,脂肪间充质干细胞(Adipose derived mesenchymal stem cell,ADSC)尤为引人注意。ADSC移植治疗不同器官损伤已经有不少文献报道,并取得了一些令人满意的结果。但关于ADSC与BMSC在移植修复SCI中有何不同效果,ADSC是否能取得像BMSC一样的或者更好的效果,目前尚无全面的数据可参考。本研究拟在以往研究的基础上,通过体内、体外实验,力争较全面的比较分析ADSC与BMSC在修复大鼠SCI中的异同点,并试图分析产生这些异同点的机制,为临床应用MSCs移植修复SCI提供理论与实验支持。 目前国外已有两个研究分别比较了ADSC与BMSC在修复大鼠心肌梗塞与缺血性脑卒中的不同疗效,这些研究所用种子细胞均是鼠来源的间充质干细胞。目前采用人来源的干细胞移植治疗大鼠SCI的报道越来越多,比如人牙髓间充质干细胞、人脐带间充质干细胞、人胎盘间充质干细胞、人诱导多能干细胞等。另外,从将来临床应用角度考虑,人来源间充质干细胞移植更符合临床应用实际。基于便于与以往研究数据比较和临床实际考虑,本研究所用间充质干细胞均为人来源的ADSC (human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cell, hADSC)与人来源的BMSC (human bone-derived mesenchymal stem cell, hBDSC)。 第一部分：人骨髓间充质干细胞与人脂肪间充质干细胞分离培养及生物学性状的比较研究 目的：分离培养人骨髓间充质干细胞(hBMSC)与人脂肪间充质干细胞(hADSC),充分比较两者的生物学特征。 方法：收集5名在我科行全髋关节置换术的成年志愿者(年龄：45-60岁,无其他基础疾病),术前签署知情同意书。术中分别收集其皮下脂肪组织与骨髓组织。采用梯度密度离心法分离培养hBMSC;采用胶原酶消化法分离培养hADSC。为减小实验误差,细胞培养过程中所用的培养基、胰酶、血清等两种细胞均一致。细胞长至80%满后胰酶消化传代。取生长良好的第4代细胞,采用CCK-8法检测细胞增殖能力、流式细胞计数进行细胞表型分析、细胞免疫荧光法鉴定表面蛋白、实时荧光定量PCR (RT-PCR)法检测营养因子mRNA表达、酶联免疫吸附试验(Enzyme-linked immunoadsordent assay, ELISA)法检测细胞分泌营养因子 功能。所有数据采用均数±标准误(x±s)来表示,并应用SPSS13.0软件进行分析。统计学方法采用两样本t检验及两因素析因分析,以P<0.05为差异有统计意义。 结果：成功分离培养两种间充质干细胞。形态上,hADSC与hBMSC类似,均成纺锤形,具备典型的MSCs的形态学特征；流式检测结果显示hADSC与hBMSC均高表达间充质标记物CD90(99.47%与99.31%),CD105(97.98%与98.46%)和粘附分子CD29(99.23%与99.31%),CD44(98.37%与98.26%)；低表达造血系细胞表面标记物CD34(0.05%与1.45%),血管内皮性抗原CD45(0.91%与0.64%),单核细胞抗原CD11b(0.02%与1.76%),和人类白细胞抗原HLA-DR(0.17%与1.45%)。细胞荧光证实,两种细胞均表达间充质干细胞标志物波形蛋白(vimentin)、层粘连蛋白(laminin)、纤连蛋白(fibronectin)与干细胞标志物巢蛋白(nestin); hADSC与hBMSC有丝分裂标志物Ki67表达率分别为57.22%±5.76%、46.02±3.18%,差异有统计学意义(t=-5.381,P=0.000)；传代后发现,hBMSC传代至第7代左右即出现老化现象,增殖能力下降,而]hADSC可传代至30代无明显变化。hADSC倍增时间明显短于hBMSC, CCK-8增殖实验结果表明,hADSC增殖速度显著快于hBMSC(p<0.05)。 RT-PRC证实hADSC表达脑源性神经营养因子(brain-derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF),血管内皮细胞生长因子(vascular endothelial cell growth factor, VEGF)与肝细胞生长因子(hepatocyte growth factor, HGF)mRNA水平显著高于hBMSC(p<0.05); ELISA实验结果进一步证实,hADSC分泌BDNF、VEGF浓度高于hBMSC(p<0.05)。 结论：本研究通过取自愿者皮下脂肪与骨髓,成功建立了分离培养hBMSC与hADSC体系。与hADSC比较,hBMSC增殖速度较慢、易老化、分泌营养因子能力弱,脂肪组织可能更适合用于分离培养间充质干细胞。 第二部分：人骨髓间充质干细胞与人脂肪间充质干细胞移植修复大鼠脊髓损伤的研究 目的：基于上一章的研究基础,制备背侧半切大鼠脊髓损伤模型,分别移植hADSC和hBSMC,比较两者对SCI大鼠的修复效果,并分析其机制。方法：取第四代hADSC与hBMSC,胰酶消化后调整细胞浓度为105/μl,备用。制备背侧半切脊髓损伤模型(以中央导水管为标准)。将实验动物随机分成三组：Ⅰ：损伤对照组,SCI后注射PBS;Ⅱ:hADSC组,SCI后移植hADSC;Ⅲ:hBMSC组,SCI后移植hBMSC.以损伤点头尾两侧各2mm为细胞移植点,将2×105个细胞移植到相应组别大鼠脊髓内。移植术后不同时间点处死大鼠。研究比较各组动物BDNF蛋白表达水平、运动功能恢复(Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan, BBB)、组织形态学修复、炎症与凋亡反应、移植干细胞存活分化及神经轴突再生等。为比较各组大鼠皮质脊髓束再生情况,于移植术后第28天每组随机选取大鼠5只,在大脑感觉运动皮层(前囟前2mm,中线旁2mm以内)注射顺行追踪剂生物素葡聚糖胺(Biotinylated Dextran Amine, BDA),2周后处死大鼠进行检测。实验中的所有数据采用均数±标准误(x±S)表示,并用统计软件SPSS13.0进行统计分析。统计学方法采用单向方差分析(one-way ANOVA)及两因素析因分析(two-way ANOVA)。方差分析显著而且方差检验齐的情况下,多重比较采用Bonferroni法；方差显著而方差不齐的情况下,采用Welch法校正F检验及Dunnett T3多重比较。以P<0.05为差异有统计意义。 结果：细胞存活、迁移、分化情况：细胞移植后一周,大鼠脊髓内可见大量移植干细胞存活,定量分析发现hBMSC组与hADSC组存活率为33.87%±4.45%,hADSC组为35.59%±5.38%,差异无统计学意义(t=-0.427,P-0.692)。至第四周时,大部分移植细胞均死亡,hBMSC组与hADSC组存活率分别为0.87%±0.25%和0.95%±0.33%(t=-0.337,P=0.753)：两种细胞的迁移方式类似,均能从移植点向损伤边缘迁移；两种细胞在宿主体内的分化情况十分类似,本研究未观察到移植干细胞分化为P-tubulin阳性神经元,NF200阳性神经丝,GFAP阳性星形胶质细胞,CNPase阳性少突胶质细胞与S100阳性雪旺细胞；两种细胞的宿主体内的分裂状况也十分相似,绝大部分移植的间充质干细胞在体内不再继续表达Ki67,未见聚集分布的Ki67阳性细胞。 (2)运动功能恢复情况：脊髓损伤后所有动物BBB评分均为0,此后逐渐恢复,一周时BBB评分恢复至4-5分,在前2周各组大鼠BBB评分差异无统计学意义,第2周开始,hADSC组大鼠BBB评分显著高于hBMSC组与损伤对照组,并一直持续到实验结束,术后4周hADSC组、hBMSC组与对照组大鼠BBB评分分别为12.5±0.5、11.2±0.6与9.2±0.3。 (3)轴突再生情况：单向方差分析显示,SCI后第4周,各组大鼠损伤周边NF200阳性纤维数差异有统计学意义(F=115.816, P=0.000), hADSCs组与hBMSCs组显著高于损伤对照组,而且]hADSCs组的数目最多。各组动物5-HT阳性纤维数目再生情况与NF200类似。对于皮质脊髓束纤维,在损伤头侧,各组均可见大量的BDA阳性纤维,而在损伤点尾端,各组均无再生的BDA阳性皮质脊髓束纤维。 (4) BDNF表达情况：Westernblot结果表明,MSCs移植组大鼠术后第3天BDNF蛋白表达水平明显高于损伤对照组,而且以hADSC组表达最高(P<.05); ELISA检测进一步证实移植术后第3天、第7天hADSC组大鼠脊髓BDNF浓度显著高于hBMSC组与损伤对照组(P<0.05)。 (5)炎症与凋亡：脊髓损伤后,由于炎症与凋亡导致大量细胞死亡,形成不利于神经再生的脊髓内环境。MSCs移植可减轻损伤周边炎症与凋亡反应。析因方差分析显示,不同组动物ED-1+阳性面积有显著差异(F组别=622.460, P组别=0.000),时间对动物ED-1+阳性面积有显著影响(F时间=240.320,P时间=0.000),时间与分组存在交互效应(F时间×分组=19.025,P时间×分组=0.000)。经单因素ANOVA分析,在损伤后1周及4周,MSCs移植显著下调损伤周边ED-1阳性炎症细胞数目,三组之间比较差异有统计学意义,以hADSC组下降的最明显(P<0.05)。凋亡分析结果显示,在细胞移植后1周hADSC组与hBMSC组、损伤对照组比较,caspase-3阳性细胞数显著减少(P<0.05)。 结论：hADSC移植到SCI大鼠体内后未见肿瘤形成等不良反应,hADSC促进SCI大鼠功能恢复的效果优于hBMSC,其机制可能与提高脊髓内BDNF表达水平、下调炎症与凋亡、促进轴突再生有关。hADSC可替代hBMSC用于移植治疗大鼠SCI。"

Methods: The first author searched PubMed, Web of Science and CNKI databases with the English search term ""Exosomes, Spinal Cord Injuries"" and the Chinese search term ""Exosomes, Spinal Cord Injuries"". According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the final results were 91 articles were selected for review. Results and conclusions: (1) In the process of using natural exosomes to treat spinal cord injury, the activity of exosomes is easily inhibited, and has shortcomings such as short half-life and poor targeting. (2) During the preparation process of exosomes, through corresponding pretreatment methods, the function and efficacy of natural exosomes in spinal cord injury can be further optimized and the possibility of adverse reactions can be reduced. (3) Common pretreatment methods include pre-culture of exosomes, pre-loading of exosomes with materials, and pre-combination of biological materials. These three pretreatment methods have their own advantages and disadvantages, and they are interventions in exosomes from different dimensions. Among them The drug delivery system constructed by pre-loading exosomes has been used the most at present, and the technology is relatively mature. Clinical research has been carried out in some fields, and it has good prospects. (4) The optimization effect of other intervention methods on exosomes has also been confirmed in experiments. These intervention measures are not independent of each other. They are organically combined to achieve multi- level pretreatment, in order to achieve complete repair after spinal cord injury. (5) Appropriate pretreatment measures can not only ensure the structure of exosomes, but also improve the targeting and stability of exosomes, extend the half-life of exosomes, strengthen the colonization of exosomes in the spinal cord injury site, and then promote Repair of spinal cord injury and improvement of neurological function for therapeutic purposes. (6) It can be seen that exosomes have great potential and broad prospects in the field of spinal cord injury.
